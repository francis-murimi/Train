212,News,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (left) talking with servicemen on May 29, 2022 during his visit to the Kharkiv region.

By

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday made his first trip to the country's war-torn east since the launch of Moscow's invasion, as Russian forces tightened their grip around key cities in the Donbas region.

Zelensky's office posted a video on Telegram of him wearing a bullet-proof vest and being shown destroyed buildings in Kharkiv and its surroundings, from where Russian forces have retreated in recent weeks.

Since failing to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the war, Russia has shifted its focus to the eastern Donbas region as it attempts to consolidate areas under its control.

Its forces said on Saturday they had captured Lyman in the contested region and were upping the pressure on the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk.

Zelensky has been based in Kyiv since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale attack on Ukraine on February 24.  

""In this war, the occupiers are trying to squeeze out at least some result,"" Zelensky said in a later Telegram post Sunday. 

""But they should have understood long ago that we will defend our land to the last man,"" he added.

The Ukrainian president was set to speak to European Union leaders at an emergency summit Monday to decide on a Russian oil embargo.

Member states were considering excluding Russian pipeline oil as they sought to break the deadlock on a sixth round of economic sanctions, EU sources told AFP.

The situation in Lysychansk had become ""significantly worse"", the regional governor of the Lugansk region, Sergiy Gaiday, said on Telegram. 

""A Russian shell fell on a residential building, a girl died and four people were hospitalised,"" he said.

On the other bank of the Donets river, Russian forces ""carried out assault operations in the area of the city of Severodonetsk,"" according to the Ukrainian general staff.

Fighting in the city was advancing street by street, Gaiday said.

In the embattled city, where an estimated 15,000 civilians remain, a local official said ""constant shelling"" made it increasingly difficult to get in or out.

""Evacuation is very unsafe, it's isolated cases when we manage to get people out. Now the priority is for the wounded and people who need serious medical assistance,"" said Oleksandr Stryuk, head of the city's military and civil administration.

The water supply is also increasingly unstable, and residents have gone more than two weeks without a mobile phone connection, he added.

On Sunday, the Russian defence ministry said it had destroyed a Ukrainian armed forces arsenal in the south eastern city of Kryvyi Rih with ""long-range high-precision missiles"". 

Russian forces also targeted a Ukrainian anti-air defence system near Mykolaivka in the Donetsk region, as well as a radar station near Kharkiv and five munitions depots, one close to Severodonetsk.

Zelensky discussed reconstruction plans with local officials on his trip to Kharkiv, saying there was a chance for areas devastated by Russian attacks to ""have a new face"".

According to local officials over 2,000 apartment blocks have been wholly or partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the region.

In the city of Kharkiv itself, customers were returning to the well-known Crystal cafe in the central public park after it reopened its doors at the end of April.

Residents come by for a coffee, a bite to eat or to sample the ""Biloshka"" ice cream, a Crystal speciality the vendor has been serving since the 1960s. 

""We need to keep employment. The city is coming back little by little,"" the cafe's manager, Alyona Kostrova, 36, told AFP.

The menu has been trimmed due to supply problems and the locale is operating with a reduced staff, down to seven or eight from 30 or 40 before the war. 

Far from the city centre in the neighbourhood of Saltivska, where Russian shells continue to fall, the atmosphere is different.

""I would not say that people are buying a lot. People have no money,"" said Vitaly Kozlov, 41, who peddles eggs, meat and vegetables locally.

Volodymyr Svidlo, 82, told AFP he ""has no pension"", and comes ""once a week"" to the neighbourhood to sell items, such as onions, dill and flowers, from his garden in order to make ends meet. 

Zelensky will speak to EU leaders at their emergency, as he seeks to crank up international pressure on Moscow.

A new round of European sanctions has been held up by Hungary, whose Prime Minister Viktor Orban has close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The landlocked country is dependent for most of its oil needs on Russian crude supplied via the Druzhba pipeline.

Hungary has asked for at least four years and 800 million euros ($860 million) in EU funds to adapt its refineries and up pipeline capacity for alternative suppliers, like Croatia.

But under a new proposal put to national negotiators on Sunday the Druzhba pipeline could be excluded from a sanctions package, which would only target oil shipped to the EU by tankers.

Their service was efficient, the food was tasty, the price was good for the portions and the ambience was incredible.



It is not every day you find yourself having a full meal at the airport. In most cases, it is just a quick pastry biting with a cup of coffee or tea as you rush through the check-in desks to finalise your booking and board your flight.

So, I was pretty amazed to find this stunning hidden cafe at the Wilson Airport in the Skyward Express Building just past the Aero club. They say this is where your grind comes to halt. As I walked in, the aroma from the freshly brewed coffee filled the air giving the cafe a warm, calming, unique ambiance with a rustic and artsy feel.

The interior design just screams artistic! From the wooden pallet seats with Orange-Maroon throw pillows, to the big yellow aircraft and blue passport painting on the wall. On the other side, they have black metallic chairs and mahogany tables facing the parking lot. 

The lighting fixtures above the tables spread warm light across the room while the handwritten illustration at the counter about the different types of coffee, helps customers decide on their coffee preferences. There is always a thing with coffee lovers and books; The café has a tiny book shelf filled with books to entertain you as you wait for your order. I found this very interesting.

Their menu is simple with just three pages, making it easy to decide on what meal you want. Since it was about 12 noon, I went for the grilled sirloin steak served with French fries and garden salad for Sh1,050 with a Vanilla milkshake for Sh420. The milkshake was served in five minutes and it was as thick as I had requested while the meal took roughly 15 minutes. The steak was hands down, one of the best steaks I have had! It had three big pieces of juicy medium rare steak covered in mushroom sauce which was served with crispy, spotless fries on a bed of freshly chopped lettuce, capsicum and carrot. 

Their service was efficient, the food was tasty, the price was good for the portions and the ambience was incredible. If you find yourself at Wilson Airport, this would be a great place to stop over and grab freshly brewed coffee, milkshakes, a meal on the go or a quick snack. Point to note is that they do not sell any alcoholic drinks.

210,News,"Moses Wetang'ula (left) and Musalia Mudavadi who are required to ‘bring’ 70 per cent of the western votes to William Ruto’s UDA presidential ticket.


By 
Letters




A Kenya Kwanza Alliance deal—whereby former Vice-President Musalia Mudavadi is to be Prime Cabinet Secretary and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula the National Assembly Speaker—recently hit the headlines.

In the deal, western counties of Busia, Bungoma, Kakamega and Vihiga would take 30 per cent of all government appointive positions. The share promised sounds good and convincing.

The trick lies in the conditions. Mudavadi and Wetang’ula are required to ‘bring’ 70 per cent of the western votes to William Ruto’s UDA presidential ticket.

This seems to be a tall order for the duo. In 2013, Mudavadi made his first stab at the presidency on a United Democratic Front ticket as Raila Odinga took his third shot at the top seat on an ODM ticket under the Cord coalition. While Raila managed an impressive second place with 43.7 per cent after President Uhuru Kenyatta, Mudavadi was an underwhelming third with only 3.96 per cent of the national tally.

In Mudavadi’s western backyard—Kakamega, Vihiga, Busia and Bungoma—he had only 29.7 per cent of the votes to Raila’s 62.2 per cent. In his home county, Vihiga, he got 49.2 per cent of the vote against Raila’s 46.4 per cent.

Wetang’ula got 46.1 per cent of the vote in Bungoma. Their combined effort, therefore, would wield roughly 39.5 per cent.

In 2017, when Mudavadi joined Raila, the latter bagged 82.8 per cent of western votes; hence, Mudavadi could only have brought in 20 per cent more votes to the ticket. But that is not entirely to his credit but Raila’s increased popularity owing to local pointmen, such as Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya.

The dynamics have changed quite significantly. Again, some local pro-Raila heavyweights have gained more publicity because of a working devolution. Besides, Wetang’ula’s Ford-Kenya and Mudavadi’s ANC are facing a very aggressive newcomer, Wafula Wamunyinyi’s DAP-Kenya.

Equally noteworthy is the mass defections from the two parties upon joining Deputy President Ruto, which saw their influence in the region take a beating.

The onslaught from this combination of factors is not going to make things any easier for the duo; in fact, they will get even fewer votes than in past polls.

Just the other day, Dr Ruto had expressed his disdain for coalitions. His intention has been to build UDA so as to have only the party advancing his agenda. His partnering with Mudavadi and Wetang’ula is a tactical optical move. It is meant to give a region like western the impression that their interests are represented in his political movement.

The deal is a no-deal as Ruto and his inner power circle see little chance for the duo to deliver. It is as if the Ruto camp, unwilling to grant their wish, set an unreasonably high target for them. The duo should therefore stop lying to their constituents.

209,News,"Not every Valentine’s Day gesture or gift will work for every woman.


By 
Simon Mburu


Reporter

Nation Media Group



It is Valentine’s Day. This is the day of love, flowers, chocolates, candle light dinners, bubble baths, and lots of sex. In fact, sex is as synonymous with Valentine’s as the colour red. But if you and your partner have been intimate before, it is easy for your sexual intercourse to get lame on this big day of love. So, what should you do to make things interesting between the sheets? Should you even go between the sheets?

Sex is not inevitable

It is commonly expected that a good Valentine’s Day will end with steamy sex. This expectation is more prevalent among men. “After spending so much to make a woman’s day, the least men expect is sex,” says psychotherapist Kelvin Mathu. But according to famous sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer who is the author of What Every Woman Needs to Know about Sexual Health, it is a mistake for men to think that sex is inevitable on Valentine’s Day. “One mistake men make every year is to bring chocolate and flowers, and then expect terrific sex just because they haven’t forgotten the holiday,” she says.

Know your woman

Not every Valentine’s Day gesture or gift will work for every woman. You must know your woman, what she likes, and what she may not find very endearing. For example, says Dr. Westheimer, one woman might like a lingerie gift while another might be offended; one woman might find it seductive while another might mistake it as your buyout to sex. “If you’re not sure whether lingerie might be accepted but still want to go that route, consider going for something neutral like an exquisite pair of underwear,” she says.

Go for him

Don’t hold back if you want your Valentine’s Day to end with terrific sexual intimacy. According to Dr. Chris Hart, going naughty is one of the sexiest ways to raise the temperature. “Try being bad. Put on something seriously skimpy, look him straight in the eye and tell him he has to do whatever you want,” he says. Dr. Hart also says that this should be the night you explore some of your fantasies. “Have you always longed to make love in the bath? Go for it!” he says.

Change the venue and the ambience

If you have been getting cozy in your bedroom with lights switched off, this is the day to up the ante. Get out of that comfort zone. Hire a hotel room, an AirBnB, or even one of the spas and saunas with facilities for couples who want intimate time. According Mathu, simply going to a different place can help you feel like you’re trying something new. “It helps if you can find an exquisite hotel. But if you don’t have the means, find a place that’s neat and affordable, where you are going to open a new chapter of romance and write something memorable,” he says.

Contraception

Choose a method of contraception that works for you and your partner. Condoms are the most popular barrier-based method. (Just make sure your partner is wearing the right size.)  Men believe wearing and removing a condom is as easy as putting on socks, but the majority use condoms wrongly. Although over 20 million condoms are used in Kenya every month, a study conducted by the National AIDS and STI Control Programme (NASCOP) shows that about 70 per cent of men in Kenya don’t know how to wear condoms properly. The condom is supposed to unroll smoothly from the rim on the outside. If you wear it inside-out such that it doesn’t roll, it is advisable that you discard it and get a fresh one. “When putting it on, squeeze the tip to get rid of any air in order to minimise chances of the rubber breaking. When withdrawing your genitals during intimacy, it is critical to hold the base of the condom to prevent it from coming off,” says general physician Dr. Ann Muritu. “Where the condom is not standard, it is important that you get the right size. Too big will slip off, too small will tear,” she says. The birth control pill is the most popular form of hormonal contraceptive. However, if you’re not using condoms, it’s important that you and your partner are tested for STIs prior to having Valentine’s Day sex.

The pressure and performance anxiety

If you have built up pressure and expectation throughout the day, it is easy for anxiety to kick in. This may result in premature ejaculation or failure by the man to come to an erection. “Such occurrences are more mental than they are physical,” says Dr. Muritu. As such, it is important to understand how you will approach sex, and especially the preparation and satisfaction of the woman. According to Mathu, oral intimacy is one way of pleasing each other that you can explore on your special night. “The majority of women do not achieve orgasm through sexual penetration. They achieve it through oral stimulation, including clitoral stimulation. Taking your hygiene into consideration, explore ways to stimulate each other, with the woman leading the man towards her erotic and pleasure zones,” he says.


On Valentine’s Day, not every bouquet of flowers is a good fit for everyone you want to gift. It is not everybody you should give red or yellow roses.


The day of love can easily turn into a day of regret and heavy losses. The show of love that dominates February 14 also creates the perfect camouflage for criminals and burglars.


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.

Former Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu has lost control of his assets after they were frozen by the High Court pending determination of a forfeiture suit filed by the anti-corruption watchdog.

The frozen assets include 18 parcels of land owned by Mr Waititu and his wife Susan Wangari. Also frozen are their six motor vehicles and one tractor.

In the order issued by Justice Esther Maina the court has restrained them and their agents from transferring, selling, transferring or charging the assets pending determination of the case. The judge directed that the case be mentioned on June 16 for hearing directions.

In the case filed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), the government is seeking to recover the couple’s unexplained wealth valued at Sh1.9 billion. Part of the wealth is registered under Mr Waititu’s three trading companies.

The trading entities are listed as Saika two estate developers limited, Bienvenue delta hotel and Bins management services limited.

EACC says the couple owns unexplained assets worth Sh1,937,709,376 amassed by Mr Waititu from 2015 when he was the Kabete MP up to 2020 when he served as the governor.

The unexplained wealth empire comprise landed property, luxurious motor vehicles and money transacted through bank accounts. He was Kabete MP from 2015 to 2017 and Kiambu governor between 2017 and 2020.

According to EACC, during the period Mr Waititu’s income from salary and his known legitimate business could not have exceeded Sh110 million. This means he made wealth that is 17 times more.

When asked the source of the wealth, EACC says the couple failed to explain despite being pressed to do so.

On September 9, 2021 the Commission says it issued notices to the couple and the trading companies to explain the disproportion in their assets with their known legitimate sources of income.

“They have up to date not furnished the EACC with any explanation as to their sources of wealth despite extension of period as requested by them and return of documents obtained during the search to enable them do so,” says the Commission’s lawyer Jacky Kibogy. 

Also Read: Ferdinand Waititu loses Sh52 million in botched property deal

Court documents indicate that Mr Waititu amassed wealth that is not commensurate to his known and legitimate sources of income, during the stated period of 2015 and 2020.

The commission established that Mr Waititu operated eight bank accounts and one loan account under his name during the period.

Mr Waitutu acquired five luxury motor-vehicles, 15 properties including in upmarket suburbs of Runda, Migaa and Thindigua and three multi-storey buildings situated in Nairobi Central Business District.

EACC alleges that Mr Waititu abused his position of trust as a public officer for private gain by engaging in transactions which were in conflict with public interest and amassed wealth by engaging in schemes to embezzle public funds through fictitious and fraudulent procurement contracts.

The assets that EACC is pursuing include the multi-storey commercial buildings in Nairobi CBD such as Jamii Bora Building bought by Mr Waititu at Sh200 million, Delta Hotel (Sh380 million), Biashara shopping Mall (Sh110 million), a house in Runda (Sh30 million), Runda Grove (Sh96 million).

They also own various other multi-million prime properties and buildings spread across the capital city and the metropolitan area.

EACC says that among the questionable properties owned by Mr Waititu personally are ten land parcels in Nairobi Kayole (two plots), Thindigua (two plots), Embakasi Ranching (two plots), Runda Grove, Migaa Esatte, Lakisama and Kencom Sacco-Runda.

They are valued at Sh280.5 million. The two plots in Kayole, valued at Sh20 million, were registered in the name of Mr Waititu and two and two minors, E.N. and O.W.

The Commission is also questioning acquisition of five motor vehicles, all registered in his name. They include two Toyota Land Cruisers, one Toyota Double Cabin, Toyota Probox and Toyota Vitz. EACC is also eyeing a sum of Sh804.6 million held in his seven bank accounts.

Towards his wife, EACC is questioning her ownership of four pieces of land in Kajiado and Kabete valued at Sh19 million and one motor vehicle that she co-owns with Ekeza Savings. Also in the list is an amount of Sh276.2 million held in her three bank accounts.

The wife is also the sole proprietor of two companies - Suwanga Limited and Connex Logistics Africa Limited – which companies traded with the County Government of Kiambu and received a sum of Sh16,423,418.

The commission argues that investigations established that Mr Waititu’s assets from the known legitimate sources of income during the period under review are a net salary of Sh29,514,080 while from his legitimate businesses he earned a net income of Sh81,366,610.

“Investigations established that he colluded with officials of the County Government of Kiambu to embezzle public funds through fictitious and fraudulent procurement contracts.

He, in abuse of his position of trust concealed or otherwise disguised his private interest in contracts awarded to companies contracted to offer services to the County,” says the EACC.

The contractors transferred proceeds of the fictitious procurement contracts to Mr Waititu, his wife and their companies as kick-backs.

207,News,"Woman choosing lingerie. Lingerie giant Victoria's Secret has paid 1,250 Thai workers who were laid-off without severance payouts mandated under Thai law.


By 
AFP




More than a thousand sacked Thai garment workers who made bras at a factory supplying lingerie giant Victoria's Secret have received a landmark $8.3 million (Sh969 million) settlement, labour rights activists said Saturday.

Brilliant Alliance Thai closed down its Samut Prakan factory in March 2021 after going bankrupt.

But the 1,250 laid-off workers -- many of whom had worked at the factory for over a decade -- did not receive severance payouts mandated under Thai law.

The factory also produced underwear for plus size American brands Lane Bryant and Torrid, owned by Sycamore Partners -- but only Victoria's Secret contributed to the settlement via a loan arrangement with the factory's owners.

Victoria's Secret confirmed in a statement that an agreement had been reached, but did not mention the amount involved.

Watch: Scared but desperate, Thai sex workers forced to the street

""Over several months we had been in active communication with the factory owners to facilitate a resolution,"" the company said.

""We regret they were not ultimately in a position to conclude this matter on their own so to ensure the workers received their full severance amounts owed, Victoria's Secret agreed to advance the severance funds to the factory owners,"" it added.

Former worker Jitnawatcharee Panad had clocked up 25 years at the factory and said more than two thirds of the sacked workers were women aged 45 or older.

""If we hadn't fought for fair compensation, we wouldn't have received anything,"" Jitnawatcharee, who is also president of the Triumph International Workers' Union of Thailand, told AFP.

""The doors of the labour ministry were locked when we went there to seek help and the minister didn't seem to want to listen to our problem.""

The agreement is the largest ever wage theft settlement at an individual garment factory, the international workers rights group Solidarity Centre said.

""I think it's extremely unprecedented and represents a new model -- the scale of severance and interest paid on it... as well as direct engagement by the brand,"" Solidarity Centre Thailand country director David Welsh told AFP.

For the past year, sacked workers and Thai union representatives have protested outside Government House in Bangkok calling for their pay.

Confederation of Industrial Labour of Thailand president Prasit Prasopsuk said some protesting workers had been charged with criminal offences, including violating public gathering rules during the pandemic.

""This case serves as a lesson in the future for the government... to ensure that foreign companies doing business in Thailand allocate some portion of monthly profit for fair compensation when these companies cease domestic operations,"" he said.

A Worker Rights Consortium report from April last year said it had documented similar wage theft cases at 31 garment factories in nine countries.

Worker Rights Consortium executive director Scott Nova said those cases were just the ""tip of the iceberg"" and the issue of wage theft in the garment industry had exploded during the pandemic as clothing orders declined.

He estimated garment workers worldwide were owed $500 million as a result of factory closures and unpaid severance.

Some workers at the Samut Prakan factory had received the equivalent of more than four years' wages last week, he said.

""It's like the equivalent of a worker's life savings... and it's simply stolen. What it means to lose that and get it back is difficult to capture in words,"" Nova added.

206,News,"Vasectomy is a reversible procedure


By 
Simon Mburu




“My wife has been on contraceptives since we started having children. Now that they are adults I have decided to undergo vasectomy and free her from contraceptives.” This is what a man identified as Kamau told the media after undergoing vasectomy at the National Theatre during the 2016 World Vasectomy Day. Kamau can be considered bold and brave because most men in Kenya do not embrace vasectomy.

Data from the Economic Survey 2020 shows that in 2019, 658 men underwent vasectomy, in 2018, the number was 646 while in 2016, the number was 919. This is in contrast to over 2.5 million women who took family planning injections in 2019 alone.

What is it?

Vasectomy, also known as male sterilisation, is a procedure that is performed on ductus deferens. “The ductus deferens, also known as vas deferens, is a thick-walled tube found in the male reproductive system. The tube transports sperm cells from the sperm storage facility known as epididymis,” says Dr. Patrick Hiuhu, a physician. He explains that during a vasectomy, the tubes are cut or sealed to prevent sperm from passing through to the urethra for ejaculation during intercourse. 

Advances in medical engineering have made the process easier to conduct. According to Dr. Charles Ochieng, the founder of Family Health Options Kenya, you don’t always have to undergo the scalpel. “The alternative procedure uses spray anaesthesia and takes about ten minutes. The tubes are accessed using equipment known as the ring clamp,” said Dr. Ochieng.

After vasectomy, it takes between one and two weeks for an incision to completely heal. Dr. Janet Brito, a certified sex therapist and co-author of Integrative Sex & Couples Therapy says that vasectomy doesn’t change the feeling or sensation during intimacy. “Most men are afraid that the sensation of orgasm is different after vasectomy. It is not. Neither is the quality or amount of semen,” she says.



Sex and vasectomy

Ejaculating ‘dry air’ is one of the commonly peddled myths about vasectomy and sex. Truth is that vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities. However, it can take up to three months after undergoing vasectomy before one can start having unprotected sex. The break is to allow your sperm count to reduce to zero. “After vasectomy, you will get clinical appointments at between 6 to 12 weeks to analyse if there is any sperm left in your semen before you can start engaging in unprotected sex,” says Dr. Hiuhu. This means that in the weeks after undergoing vasectomy, you will need to use protection during intercourse because your semen may still contain sperm that could be potent enough to cause pregnancy.

Is it reversible?

Vasectomy is a reversible mode of family planning. According to urologist Dr. Sarah Vij, the success rate of a vasectomy reversal will mainly depend on the time that has elapsed since the procedure was done. Where a reversal procedure is done within the first ten years, chances of success are as high as 95 percent. From 15 years and above, the rate of success declines significantly.

Does vasectomy cause prostate cancer?

According to medical research of 42,000 men aged 40 and above who had undergone vasectomy in the United States, there is no link between vasectomy and the onset of fatal prostate cancer. The result of this medical research by the American Cancer Society was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016. The research also found that men who undergo vasectomy do not have an increased risk of getting prostate cancer. If they get prostate cancer, they are not more likely to die from it than men who don’t undergo vasectomy. Men who’d want to lower their risk of fatal prostate cancer need to maintain a healthy weight and quit smoking, which is associated with a high risk of fatal prostate cancer,” said Dr. Eric Jacobs, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society who led this research.




More and more men are avoiding the doctor. Or worse, not going at all.


At least 4.2 million Kenyans require medical assistance to conceive.

He added that the change would bring to an end the process of ""increasing the brand value of our country,"" an initiative started by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has led the country for almost two decades.

Over the past few years, the country has sought to change the branding on its products from ""made in Turkey"" to ""made in Turkiye.""

In addition to making the UN's nomenclature match how the nation is spelled in Turkish, the update would also help distinguish the country from the bird of the same name in English.

""The name change may seem silly to some but it puts Erdogan in the role of protector, of safeguarding international respect for the country,"" Georgetown University professor Mustafa Aksakal was quoted as saying in The New York Times.

The newspaper also noted that the move comes ahead of next year's presidential election as well as the centenary of the nation's founding after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

The new Netflix docuseries Our Great National Parks takes viewers to national parks around the world, from the Chilean Patagonia to Kenya’s Tsavo East National Park to the soothing narration of one of the show’s executive producers, former US President Barack Obama.

If you’ve ever been to Kilaguni Serena Safari Lodge and taken a tour with them or you’ve been longing to savour travel sights and sounds particularly after two years of Covid-19-linked lockdown, then view this inviting unveiling of ravishingly varied landscapes, seascapes, and surprising animal escapades.

Many of the locations featured in the series were selected because of Obama’s personal connection to the parks and this is clear when he introduces Kenya’s biggest national park.

“The first time I visited Kenya, about 30 years ago, I was a stranger,” says Obama. “This was the land of my father, who had passed away and whom I barely knew. But I had met my family. I visited the village that they came from. I felt welcomed everywhere. And as my sister and I spent a few days on safari, I felt something else: awe. The African bush...swept on forever with wide-open skies and wildlife that never seemed to end. What a gift to see the world anew, to see the place where ultimately all of us come from.”

Joanne Scofield, the producer-cum-director of the third episode that is about Tsavo, remarks that “super tuskers are super elusive”.

“There are only 30 or so of these enormous, iconic elephants left in Africa and Tsavo is home to a third of them. But finding one in such a vast area is no easy task. With the support of the Tsavo Trust and the Kenyan Wildlife Service, we were fortunate enough to seek out and film one of the oldest bulls. We spent an entire day with him as he swaggered between waterholes, checking out the herds. He even fell asleep for an hour leaning on his gigantic tusks! It was an honour to accompany him through the bush and spend time in his huge presence,” he said.

According to Henrietta Karimi, the manager of Serena Lodge, the crew camped at her hotel for months. She added that they even had to convert one of the rooms into a studio. 

“We knew they were filming something important because of the equipment they had. But we didn’t know it was a documentary that was to be narrated by Obama. We wish he had also visited us,” she said.

In the documentary, Obama says in his baritone voice: “The sight of dust-red elephant wallowing, rolling and spraying each other with the midnight blue waters of palm-shaded Galana River is one of the most evocative images in Africa.” 

He goes on: “This, along with the 300-kilometre-long Yatta Plateau, the longest lava flow in the world, make for an adventure unlike any other in the Tsavo East.”

The park forms the largest protected area in Kenya and is home to most of the largest mammals on the planet. 

Producers of the documentary said they had 33 expeditions of 10 countries in five continents, filming for over 1,500 days. 

They were also working with a number of people in each country, which not only allowed them to minimise on air travel but it also helped them when the pandemic hit.

“We were relying on people in-country and they were giving us such a unique and rare perspective of their national parks because, of course, to them, they’re their backyards. They’re the places that they’re the most connected to,” said executive producer James Honeyborne.

The documentary is currently streaming on Netflix.

Welcome!"
203,News,"Dr. Catherine Kyobutungi Executive Director of the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)


By 
Elizabeth Merab


Health & Science Reporter

Nation Media Group





How did you get to this position?

I have been with APHRC since 2006 when I joined as a post-doctoral researcher right after my PhD. Over time, I developed my research skills and took up progressively higher-level leadership roles within the organisation, from leading a small team, to a large unit, then the Director of Research. When the current position became vacant, I was competitively selected from hundreds of other applicants. Each leadership position exposed me to the ways in which the organisation is run and as a director of research, I was familiar with almost all aspects of the organisation, so it was easy to step into the top leadership position.

What motivates you? 

I am motivated by the strong belief that what we are doing at APHRC is important and necessary. Seeing the Center grow every year, seeing the personal growth of staff, and the Center’s footprint getting bigger and stronger uplifts me – it tells me we are doing the right things and so we should keep going.

Are there any challenges you’ve faced as a woman in science? 

Everyone faces challenges in their journey. My biggest challenges were when I started a family and juggled work in a very busy organisation while being a mum. It was difficult to keep up with everything I needed to do and give my daughter the attention she needed and so sometimes work took precedence. Luckily I realised that early on and was able to self-correct and give her maximum attention the few hours I was with her and then work when she went to bed, which meant that I had to spend a few more hours working to make up for the time. It was really tough. With my second born, I was wiser.

What advice would you give a young woman eager to join your line of work?

The pipeline for women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in Africa is very weak, so my first piece of advice would be: do not let society’s expectations of you, define who you are. If you are good at something, go for it, no matter what naysayers tell you. Secondly, whatever you do, do your best – whether it is studies, household chores, sports, or community work - do your best always.

Dr. Marianne Wanjiru Mureithi, chair, Department of medical microbiology & immunology and a senior research fellow/ lecturer at the University of Nairobi, Kenya.

How did you get to this position? 

It takes a village, as they say; my parents were an excellent source of inspiration for my work in science; they believed that nothing was impossible and gave me a good solid foundation. I am also privileged to be surrounded by good mentors and role models who are passionate about my overall success.

What motivates you?

The power and impact of science in our daily lives have always been visible and real, especially now in the age of emerging new infections and pandemics, not forgetting the ever-present threat of the effect of climate change on human health. In my current research, I am deeply driven by the hope and dream of a world without AIDS in my lifetime, with an HIV vaccine readily available and routinely administered across sub-Saharan Africa, which bears the brunt of this devastating disease. To achieve this novel life-changing goal, I have dedicated my life and research work to help find a cure. I am at the forefront of discovering novel HIV vaccines and preventative measures.

Are there any challenges you've faced as a woman in science?

Women in science face a myriad of challenges, some of which are; availability of funding for research & innovation, more opportunities for leadership development, especially for women in science, more opportunities to network and build collaborations. I am also working towards a good work-life balance because I believe as women in science, with the proper support we can have it all.

What advice would you give a young woman eager to join your line of work? 

Nelson Mandela once said, ""It always seems impossible until it is done, so for starters believe in yourself and your abilities, remain curious about how things work and how you can improve the outcomes of what does not work quite well... a solution-oriented person. Be passionate about what you do and identify good role models and mentors who will assist you in awakening and nurturing the science passion. Most importantly, believe in oneself, keep rooted in God, the bearer of all knowledge, and in my opinion, the most outstanding scientist of them all.

Miriam Mutebi consultant breast surgical oncologist and assistant professor in surgery at the Aga Khan University (AKU) Medical College.

How did you get to this position?

My career was influenced by my experiences while in medical school. Surgery is more result-oriented compared to other areas, and therefore, more appealing. We were at the height of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, many African patients lacked access to antiretroviral therapies (ARTs), a situation that created a sense of hopelessness. With surgery, it’s pretty direct: a patient comes in, you operate on them and they go home to recover.

I got interested in breast surgery which was part of our surgical rotation after realising younger women, in their 30s and 40s, who had multiple children and had breastfed, (often perceived as protection against cancer predisposition) were increasingly getting diagnosed with breast cancer. Many of them with late-stage disease. I wanted to make a difference and change their health outcomes.

What motivates you?

The ability to make a difference. I am in the hope business and therefore want to change the narrative that cancer is equal to a death sentence.

With breast cancer, we have been educating patients that science has seen advancement in treatment and if caught early, cancer can be treated appropriately and you will live a quality life.

I have made it my mission to empower women to take control over their bodies and health. I do so by creating a space in my clinic that not only serves to examine the women but also allows them to safely talk about any underlying issues and equip them with appropriate tools. I noticed most of the time the woman who will come to the clinic suspicious about the lump in her breast often just needs psychosocial support and not necessarily surgery.

Are there any challenges you've faced as a woman in science?

Unconscious bias especially in places where you are a pioneer. Everyone coming after you will be judged based on your character, behaviour, and achievements.

Secondly, there is a risk of being underestimated, which can work for or against you.

What advice would you give a young woman eager to join your line of work?

For you to succeed in anything you need to put in the work. There is no substitute. Choose something you are passionate about because it is the grease that keeps the wheel turning on days you feel less motivated. Even if I was not getting paid to do what I do, I would still do it. That is how much passion I have for my work.

Finally, representation matters. Unless you see someone in that position, you cannot relate to the aspirations you have. You also need to try options and see what resonates with you.


From menstrual cramps to ovarian cancer, there are a number of health concerns that women have to deal with on a regular basis. While some merely affect their daily activities, others are...


The history of health inventions and discoveries is a long and illustrious one, filled with names of great men who have changed the course of medicine. However, many people do not know that women...

Rupi Mangat






At the crack of dawn on the last day of 2021, the sun in the eastern sky bursts like a furnace of red-orange flames to begin its daily swoop over the earth. In the midst of it, we’re driving through the sugar-cane fields on the plains of Chemelil at the foothills of the magnificent Nandi Hills in western Kenya.



The plan for the day is to enjoy the cool mountain air on Tinderet, a volcanic massif across the road from the Nandi stretch of hills, famous for its flashes of lightening from which it derives its name Tinderet – and the once upon-a-time elephant. The last bull elephant survived until the new millennium.



Tinderet looms with its highest peak pointing to the sky as we turn in at Songhor with more sugar-cane plantations and a prehistoric site that dates some 15 million years ago with fossils that lay buried courtesy of Tinderet’s volcano when it erupted. The cane gives way to cleared patches of the once forested hills and tea – lush green climbing up the mountain, neatly laid out.



It’s the Williamson tea estate that started planting tea on Tinderet in 1956 on a eucalyptus farm. The new tea bushes were planted with a seed flown in from Kiganga in Tanzania. In 1961 when the first leaf was processed in the new factory, Tinderet won many awards at the Eldoret Agricultural Show courtesy of the perfect soil and the essential rain provided by Tinderet’s indigenous forest.



The road turns into murrum and the higher we climb, the cooler and fresh the air becomes. The indigenous forest lining the tea plantations is a thick, impenetrable cover – like giant heads of broccoli. 



And then like magic, as if turning a new page in a novel, the road runs through an alpine zone of giant lobelias, their long stems drooping with the weight of the flowers – in botanical terms called the inflorescence. We’ve reached the moorland! These long-stemmed forest plants need sunbirds to pollinate them, so we are assured of seeing the pretty nectar-sucking birds.



It’s a beautiful drive up the mountain that’s almost 7,000 feet high with the lobelias and giant ferns peeking through the forest trees, the undergrowth a rich tapestry of vines and twines. The rivers running down the slopes like the mighty Nyando keep the great African lake, Victoria, fresh.



Suddenly there’s a clearing in the forest of carpeted grass like out of the movies. The highest point of Tinderet looms in the distant. 



A herder leads his cows down the red earth road and we reach the edge of the forest with a potato field in flowers of lilac and neighbouring it, the forester’s office that has no sign.



The foresters allow us to enjoy a picnic breakfast in the natural glade open to the skies. The air is heady as we breathe in large doses of pure oxygen, filling our lungs to capacity –an escape from the masked-days of the Covid pandemic.



A turaco moves through the branches of a cedar tree. The colobus monkeys screech out as the sun begins to warm the forest. The breakfast of hot coffee and toast tantalizes the buds. 



The forester, Erick Rotich shows us around the nursery of indigenous trees of podos and cedar, native to the forest.



The forest man tells us we are in Tendeno forest and not Tinderet forest, which borders it.



“Tinderet forest falls under Nandi County while Tendeno forest falls under Kericho County,” explains Gibson Kitsao of Nature Kenya, the natural history society formed in 1909 and open to membership. 

“In the old days, the local people relied on the lightning from the forests to determine their seasons.” 



There are no hiking trails or guides to guide us through the ancient forest. However, with prior arrangement this can be arranged tells the forester.



Tendeno is rich in history. It is one of the forest homes of the Ogiek people, whose name means ‘caretaker of all plants and wild animals’. They are one of Kenya’s last remaining hunter-gather communities, living in the forests of the Mau, Elgon and Tinderet. As specialized honey gatherers, it was in their interest to keep the forests alive. However, the community has been repeatedly evicted from the forests but a landmark ruling on 26 May 2017 (after an eight-year court battle) by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights based in Arusha, Tanzania, ruled in the community’s favour. But nothing has come of it since.



A slow drive down the forest slope reveals indigenous trees being felled along the road for it to be tarmacked to Kericho. 



Travel Tinderet



Tendeno forest is 700 hectares while Tinderet is 7000 hectares.

This fascinating volcano is accessible via the Chemelil-Nandi road. Other sites of interest are the Nandi Bears Club for golfers, exploring the many sites on the long stretch of Nandi Hills for hiking, birding and cultural tours like the museum dedicated to the Nandi leader Koitalel Arap Samoei killed by a colonial administrator, the prehistoric site at nearby Fort Ternan and the longest bridge in East Africa and so much more.  For accommodation, try Nandi Bears club, Kweisos House or do a day trip from Kisumu, Kericho or Eldoret.

201,News,"People dressed up as Santa Claus take part in the traditional Santa Claus run in Madrid on December 12, 2015. The race was organised by one of Spain's leading department stores to raise funds for the Foundation for Multiple Sclerosis Madrid.



Today is World Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Day. The day is commemorated to raise awareness of sclerosis and support and connect to the many people living with it.

Sclerosis is a common disease of the nerves that causes damage to the myelin sheath, which covers the central nervous system in the spinal cord and brain.

The day was first celebrated in 2009 by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation (MSIF).This year’s theme, “I connect, we connect”, is about connection building to fight this condition, a global public health menace.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and MSIF say sclerosis affects some 2.3 people. Sadly, thousands of people have gone undiagnosed of this disease because it is unpredictable, progressive and challenging to diagnose. Sclerosis is one of the neurological disorders to which more females than males are vulnerable.

The lifelong condition has no specific cause but scientists are trying to establish it. Many suggest that it might be a connection between the onset of the disease and genes but stress is also suggested to be a cause and even the infectious agents.

Symptoms include muscle weakness, double vision, mental and physical problems, depression, speech and swallowing problems. The condition is destructive since, if the underlying symptoms are not treated through several therapies, the resulting damage to the myelin sheath disrupts the flow of the information within the brain and between the brain and body.

The interruption of communication signals causes the listed unpredictable symptoms of this worrying condition.

It is high time the government and concerned stakeholders prioritised tackling this condition. Let’s raise awareness of the disease, let’s discover people who are affected and come up with a lasting solution to make them survive with the condition.

MS has no cure but symptoms that accompany the condition can be treated, hence limiting its progression. Health facilities should prioritise several therapies since many experts have proven to be helpful in tackling it .It’s advisable to do a lot of physical exercise and vulnerable groups should be free from stress.

The Ministry of Health should limit barriers to access physiotherapy and medication against this condition, it should be free since many people cannot afford treatment. Early diagnosis is instrumental to limit its negative effects and management.

MS is still a threat to human life. Let the world understand this and tackle it for the wellbeing of the citizens. Above all, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved by Kenya Vision 2030 if we are to eliminate this menace in the world at large.

Communities and health facilities should connect with one another to recognise MS patients and try to come up with a lasting solution to the situation.

For any sweet tooth person or just any foodie, Artcaffé coffee and bakery is one of those places you just can’t pass by. With over 35 branches in Kenya, the eatery has made a brand out of its name. All these eateries have a full-service and on the move bakery coffee shop, restaurant and bar with a wide variety of meals and drinks on the menus.

I attended the launch of their latest branch in Westlands - the Artcaffé Market, gourmet food store and I was amazed. This new location is just 15 minutes away from Nairobi CBD at Rhapta Square on Rhapta road. You can’t miss the big brightly-lit signage on the road. 

Sweet tooth heaven at Artcaffé Rhapta Square. Photo | Pool



I got a very warm welcome from the hostess with a complimentary glass of champagne before a tour of the new property. This three-storey building is a one stop shop for all your needs. On the ground floor is the Artcaffé Market Cellar and Gourmet food store which is fully stocked with the finest selection of locally sourced and imported foods and drinks. It offers an inspiring shopping experience including Artcaffé products.

On the second floor, is the spacious Artcaffé coffee & bakery- restaurant whereby you can relax, eat and catch a break after your shopping. They have an entirely new addition to their pastry menu. On the same floor is Peekaboo kids and more store which sells kids toys and games. 

My favourite part of the store, apart from the fully stocked wine and spirit shop on the ground floor was the rooftop bar. This is where the party lives and the setup was beautifully done with a wide range of pastries and cakes to entice the taste buds. There were assorted croissants, brioches, mini tarts, pecan pies, cookies, cake slices and mousses. I don’t think I have had so much sugar in my system in my entire adulthood. 

I loved the scrumptious pecan pie and the homemade mini-quiches made with buttery short crust pastry and filled with feta cheese and chicken. For the cakes, I settled on the all-time favourite- Salted caramel and cappuccino with an extra slice of Trico lad. All these sugar and more glasses of sparkling wine under the bright moonlight as we were being serenaded by the live band was just heavenly. The rooftop bar is perfect for a date night under the stars with a view of the Nairobi skyline.

199,News,"Students take part in an anti-government demonstration in Colombo on May 29, 2022 demanding the resignation of Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the country's crippling economic crisis.


By 
AFP




Cash-strapped Sri Lanka on Tuesday announced steep, across-the-board tax hikes to shore up revenue as the country suffers its worst economic downturn and seeks an IMF bailout.

The value-added tax (VAT) applied on almost all goods and services was raised from 8.0 per cent to 12 per cent with immediate effect, while corporate taxes were also increased from 24 to 30 per cent.

The personal income tax exemption threshold was lowered from 3.0 million rupees (USD8,330) a year to 1.8 million rupees.

The increases were a rollback of the generous cuts ordered by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa soon after he won the November 2019 elections.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the finance minister, said Rajapaksa's tax cuts cost the state some 800 billion rupees ($2.22 billion) annually and widened the budget deficit sharply.

International rating agencies, as well as independent economists, have pointed to Rajapaksa's fiscal policy as having fuelled the current financial crisis.

Wickremesinghe, an opposition legislator, was made prime minister this month.

His predecessor and the president's elder brother Mahinda stepped down after months of anti-government protests turned deadly.

The South Asian nation is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a bailout after running out of dollars to pay even for the most essential imports such as oil, food and medicines.

Sri Lanka has also defaulted on its USD51 billion foreign debt.

Wickremesinghe said he was also removing several tax breaks granted to companies in recent years.

The government did not say how much it will raise from the new tax measures.

However, the prime minister had said they had run out of rupees to pay the salaries of 1.5 million civil servants and would have to ""print money"". That would in turn fuel inflation, which is already at a record 33.8 per cent.

By 
Veronica Onjoro


PhD student 

Mount Kenya University 



 It was refreshing news when a leading presidential candidate picked a woman as his running mate. This woman has many feathers in her cap. A senior lawyer and member of the civil society, former Cabinet minister, MP,  presidential candidate, was involved in Constitution writing and has the moniker “Iron Lady”

Senior Counsel Martha Wangari Karua is a politician and advocate of social justice. She is a former long-standing MP for Gichugu and an advocate of the High Court of Kenya. She was Minister for Justice until her resignation in April 2009.

Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition presidential candidate Raila Odinga’s choice has excited many women. They are imagining that when the duo are elected, there is a chance of her becoming the next president—probably in 2027, since the former Prime Minister has promised to retire after one term.

As in neighbouring Tanzania, where Samia Suluhu Hassan is the President, a woman in Kenya’s State House would be historic and exciting. Karua carries the hopes and aspirations of many women. Mr Odinga may get the numbers in central Kenya, Gusii and northeastern regions just because of the “Martha moment” (like the “Mandela moment” in South Africa).

Karua is proof of recognition and inclusion of women in our politics. It is high time a woman was sponsored to vie for the governorship in every county in 2027, so that when Karua becomes President, they will follow in her footsteps.

This is a big step in women empowerment and gender balance. A woman Deputy President in 2022 and President in 2027 is an exciting proposition and could be the catalyst to propel more women into top leadership positions or politics.

Women are an embodiment and force in problem-solving. When Karua is campaigning, her words are encouraging, measured and uniting. A woman leadership is devoid of corruption, embezzlement of funds, loss and misuse of money, ghost projects, disunity and divisive politics.

197,News,"Good sleep hygiene increases your energy levels throughout the day.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




If you struggle to get restful sleep at night, you are not alone. But there are ways to put an end to sleepless nights.

To begin with, the duration and quality of your sleep determine whether you will wake up feeling refreshed or not.

Next, we discuss tips that will give you that rejuvenating sleep.

Identify what time you need to wake up in the morning

This will make it easier for your body and brain to adapt. Once you have identified the time, use self-discipline to change any bad habits that disrupt sound sleeping patterns.

Set a bedtime and stick to it even if you're not tired

If you're in the habit of going to bed at different times every night, it will be difficult for your body and mind to get used to this new schedule. Set an early bedtime even if you are not tired yet because having control over your body allows you to stay on track with daily routines without mental strain caused by a lack of restful nights.

Reduce blue light exposure before going to sleep by turning off electronics 

Exposure to blue light from electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, or tablets can prevent melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep when you finally get into bed. Of course, you don't have to cut out electronics after a certain time at night but try to limit your use. One way to work around this is by installing free apps which reduce the amount of blue light from your screens.

Create a relaxing pre-sleep routine

This is one of the most important aspects of maintaining healthy sleep hygiene as it can make or break your efforts to get more restful nights. It can take some time and effort to find out what works for you, but once you do, an effective pre-sleep routine will help clear your mind from any remaining anxieties that might be creeping up before bedtime.

For example, some people prefer reading a book before going to sleep while others find it easier listening to soft music or even taking a hot bath or shower beforehand.

Do not engage in any activities that are too stimulating such as watching action movies late at night, which can leave your mind running wild with thoughts of what will happen next.

Avoid caffeine after 2 pm and alcohol at night 

If you are having trouble with your sleep cycle, try and cut back on your caffeine intake in the afternoon or evening. Caffeine is known for stimulating the brain. Therefore, it is best to avoid it in the hours before bedtime. You can make a conscious effort to drink more water throughout the day, which may eventually reduce or even cut out caffeinated beverages altogether.

Likewise, you should cut back on alcohol intake after dinner. Although it may initially make you feel sleepy or relaxed, too much alcohol can interrupt your sleep cycle by causing disruptions in the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage of your sleep.

Exercise regularly 

It is a good idea to exercise regularly because it can help get your body tired and ready for sleep. However, it is not recommended that you do this right before going to sleep. The increased blood flow and energy levels from physical activity can make it difficult for your mind and body to get into a restful mode.

For example, if you go for a jog right before turning in for the night, chances are that once your head hits the pillow, at least one part of your body (if not more) will still be active, and it will be difficult to fall asleep.

Likewise, if you are having trouble sleeping, stay away from potentially stressful activities in your day to reduce the stress levels that are already preventing you from getting a good night's rest.

Benefits of good sleep hygiene




Fortunately, different treatments are available today for insomnia today. They include prescription medication, over-the-counter sleep aids and cognitive behavioural therapy.


Effects of not getting enough sleep include irritability, anxiety, problems concentrating or remembering things, weight gain, and an increased risk of diabetes.

196,News,"Coffee is a central nervous system stimulant.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Are you one of those people who can't function without taking a cup of coffee in the morning? Or must you take a cup of coffee in the evening after a long day of work, to help you relax?

Turns out, this habit might be doing more harm than good.

Coffee stimulates your nervous system, giving you an initial boost of energy and alertness. However, once caffeine's effects wear off, you feel tired and sleepy. This is because caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, a sleep-promoting chemical in your brain, slowing down nerve cells.

Coffee has both positive and negative effects depending on the amount of coffee you take and when you take it.

Coffee is a central nervous system stimulant. It can have a positive effect on your response, mood, and mental performance. Coffee can keep you alert enough to work when you are short on sleep.

There is evidence that coffee can help reduce anxiety. However, in high doses, caffeine can increase pressure or cause restlessness.

Coffee works best when taken once in a while.

Coffee affects your ability to fall asleep and reduces the time and quality of your sleep. Interrupted sleep can lead to sleep deprivation characterised by fatigue. Interrupted sleep also disrupts your daytime performance. In addition, sleep deprivation leads to a significant decrease in mental functioning including attention span, alertness, vigilance, and the speed of mental and emotional responses.

Taking coffee at night can cause insomnia symptoms or can increase existing wakefulness. It can also cause anxiety and poor-quality sleep.

If you take coffee six hours before bedtime, you may still feel the effects when you go to bed.

Coffee can slow down your body time, reducing your overall sleep time and the amount of deep sleep you enjoy.

When you drink coffee, your stomach and small intestine absorb caffeine and redistributes it through your bloodstream to other parts of your body, including your brain. Once caffeine reaches your brain, it sticks to your adenosine receptors.

When caffeine binds to your adenosine receptors, your brain stops processing it. Once the effects of caffeine decrease, there's adenosine build-up on your brain's receptors, which can make you feel tired.

During deep sleep, the tissues in your body are repaired, and your brain stores new information and gets rid of toxic waste. Sleep deprivation interferes with your attention, weakening the ability to complete cognitive tasks that require attention.  Good sleep can enhance problem-solving skills, improve memory performance, and can improve your productivity.

Sleep quality and duration can have a significant impact on many aspects of your health. Sleep helps your body and mind relax and recover energy. When you are deprived of sleep, your body releases stress hormones that can cause you to react in less productive ways.

Since coffee can be both helpful and harmful depending on the dose, find a level of consumption that is healthy for you. Coffee can be very effective in improving your concentration, alertness, and energy. But these effects can be short-lived if you consume high doses of coffee daily.

Coffee can also reduce the amount and quality of your sleep. These effects can take place even when you are unaware of them. When the effect wears off, you may feel tired and sleepy as you experience the effects of adenosine build-up, dehydration, decreased blood sugar, and more.




Sleep apnea is a condition that happens when someone stops breathing when they are asleep, which leads to an interruption in their deep sleep cycle.

195,News,"On average, adults need 8 hours of sleep per night to function well during the day.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Studies show that people who regularly sleep for less than six hours a night are more likely to be depressed, and have higher rates of suicide or self-harm. The reason for this correlation is that when the body does not get enough rest, it releases hormones called cortisol which increase stress levels in the brain.

When you don't get enough sleep, you produce less serotonin, and this increases anxiety. If you know someone with depression encourage them to get plenty of rest.

Sleep deprivation refers to lack of sleep, or not having enough hours in a 24-hour period to entirely refresh oneself for natural bodily purposes such as healing, growth, and regeneration.

Effects of not getting enough sleep include irritability, anxiety, problems concentrating or remembering things, weight gain, and an increased risk of diabetes.

Lack of sleep can also lead to increased feelings of sadness and hopelessness, which can trigger thoughts of suicide.

A sleep-deprived person is likely to have these symptoms: 

The first and probably most common cause of sleep deprivation is not sleeping enough. On average, adults need 8 hours of sleep per night to function well during the day. Less sleep can lead to drowsiness and trouble concentrating as well as irritability and mood swings.

The second major cause of sleep deprivation is ""sleep debt"" which develops over time when an individual consistently sleeps less than their body needs. Some factors which can increase a person's risk for developing a sleep debt include a stressful lifestyle, a new baby in the home, or changing one's work hours. An example is when one returns to work after maternity leave. They may have been used to sleeping longer hours but suddenly have to go to work during the day and take care of the baby at night. It is easy for such a person to develop a sleep debt.

People who suffer from depression tend to have a higher rate of sleep deprivation. This is because they often lack motivation and energy, making it difficult for them to get up in the morning, let alone go to bed at a reasonable time each night. In addition, many people with depression have insomnia or other sleeping disorders such as restless leg syndrome, which makes it difficult to fall asleep.

People with depression are also more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, drinking alcohol excessively, and taking over-the-counter medications and prescription medication which can disrupt sleep patterns. In addition, when individuals who are depressed don't get enough sleep, it frequently leads to other depressive feelings as their bodies do not have the energy or motivation to want to accomplish anything.

Here is what you can do to help yourself if you feel depressed:

It is easy for many people with depression to become discouraged and lose motivation when they cannot get a good night's rest. This can make it even difficult for them to function well during the day, triggering additional feelings of sadness and despair.

When people become depressed, it is important that they seek help from a specialist to combat the symptoms and get their lives back on track again.

194,News,"Sleep apnea happens when someone has breathing difficulties while asleep. The condition is common among adults, especially men over 50 years old.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




It's the zombie apocalypse! Everyone is more tired than usual lately, and that's because of a lack of enough sleep.  Just kidding. Point is, it is important to get enough rest whenever you can because this helps you feel refreshed and keeps you alert throughout the day.

Sleep apnea is a condition that keeps you from having enough sleep. The condition is common among adults, especially men over 50 years old.

Sleep apnea happens when a person stops breathing while they sleep, which leads to an interruption in their deep sleep cycle. This often leaves them feeling exhausted when they wake up.

Sleep apnea is a condition that happens when people stop breathing during their sleep for long periods, sometimes more than 30 seconds at a time. While sleeping, the muscles and tissues in your throat relax and block your airway. As a result, you can begin snoring, choking, or gasping for breath until you awaken enough to resume normal breathing.

This cycle of interrupted breathing disrupts your sleep and leads to less restorative sleep overall.

There are two types of sleep apnea: Obstructive and central

Obstructive sleep apnea is when your airway becomes blocked, causing you to stop breathing for some time during the night. This is because the muscles and tissues in your throat relax and block your airway while you sleep, making it close up or narrower. When this happens, you will snore loudly, gasp for air, or make choking sounds until you wake up enough to resume normal breathing.

Central sleep apnea is less common and can happen when your brain doesn't send the proper signals to the muscles in the throat and chest which control your breathing during sleep. This is often caused by a disruption in the central nervous system.

Snoring, fatigue, and restless sleeping are the most common symptoms while gasping or choking is a more severe sign of this disorder. In addition, they may experience dry mouth in the morning and cognitive impairment such as trouble concentrating.

Sleep apnea can be diagnosed by a sleep study called nocturnal polysomnography, which monitors your breathing, brain activity, and oxygen levels while you sleep. This is the best way to diagnose this disorder because it tests for all types of sleep apnea, including central and obstructive.

The first is lifestyle changes like losing weight or quitting smoking, which reduce the symptoms associated with this condition.

Another type of treatment for sleep apnea is nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). It delivers pressurized oxygen through a mask worn over the nose to keep your throat open while sleeping, so there's no pause in breathing during inhalation and exhalation. This treatment helps people fall asleep quickly and stay asleep throughout the night without disruptive pauses in their respiratory cycle.

The use of hypoglossal nerve stimulators is the third type of treatment for sleep apnea. These are small implants beneath the skin that stimulate hypoglossal nerves that control one side of the tongue. This nerve stimulation causes your throat muscles to contract, keeping your airway open so you can breathe normally without interruption or snoring.

Surgery may also be recommended to remove excess tissue in your throat. There's a chance that performing surgery alone won't cure your sleep apnea, but it may help. Although the surgery is effective for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cases, this procedure will not be as successful at resolving or improving symptoms if you have severe obstructive sleep apnea. The surgeon can remove your tonsils from above the soft palate muscles and trim down your soft palate and uvula.

Lastly, oral appliances such as mouth guards that you wear while you sleep can open up your airways and prevent them from closing or becoming blocked. These also hold the lower jaw slightly forward, helping to keep the tongue from falling back and blocking the airway.

Sleep apnea is a severe disorder that happens when a person's breathing is interrupted during sleep. It can have many adverse effects on your health, including cognitive impairment and even death if left untreated. However, treatments are available for sleep apnea which range from lifestyle changes to surgical procedures or oral appliances.

If you think you may be suffering from this condition, please consult your doctor or a sleep specialist who will diagnose it through nocturnal polysomnography testing. They'll also recommend the best treatment option for you based on the severity of your symptoms and what type of sleep apnea (central vs obstructive) you suffer from.




Effects of not getting enough sleep include irritability, anxiety, problems concentrating or remembering things, weight gain, and an increased risk of diabetes.

193,News,"When children are raised by a single father or mother, they grow up with social and psychological inhibitions that affect their worldviews, according to research.

Of the many choices Wanjiku Kariuki has made in life, being a single mother was not one of them. Her desire was to get married, have children, raise them with her husband, and live happily ever after.

She did get married — at 23 — and have a child a year later. Her happily-ever-after, though, was short-lived. Cracks emerged in her marriage after two years, and soon afterwards the relationship collapsed. Wanjiku, 31, admits she was young and naïve at the time. For the last seven years, the businesswoman has raised her daughter, now eight, alone after the man she had been married to abandoned them.

‘‘I was raised by my father after my mother died and always wanted to build a family with someone. When my husband and I went our separate ways, I wanted him to be part of our daughter’s life, at least by spending time with her, even without providing. He refused,’’ she says, adding: ‘‘I have made my daughter understand that people can disagree, that they can live separately, and that this does not make her different from children who have both parents.’’

Also Read: ‘I fell in love with a celebrity, and I never want to date one ever again’

Wanjiku’s story and the acceptance of her fate is the story of millions of single parents in Kenya, a number that has been rising at an alarming rate in the past decade, and which affects women more than men. When President Uhuru Kenyatta highlighted the issue during his Madaraka Day address on Wednesday, it pointed to Kenya’s social dysfunction that has been brewing silently in recent years, but which now threatens to get out of hand. The ‘social dysfunction’ reference here is based on the text book definition of a family, which, as young children in school are taught even today, includes mother, father and a child or children.

President Kenyatta’s remarks, perhaps, were borne of that understanding, and indicated in their grimness that the government, just like society, still looks at the completeness of family from that — some would say ‘narrow’ — perspective.

‘‘If unchecked, this trend could destroy the fundamental character of Kenya and [wreak] untold harm onto our most vulnerable and precious members: our children,” said the President. ‘‘I urge our media houses, religious leaders, community elders and the concerned government agencies to step up to the plate and make sure that the Kenyan family remains the strong and respected institution that it has historically been.”

Statistics on family in Kenya are startling. From 25 per cent households headed by a single parent in 2009, the number had shot to a staggering four out of 10 (or 40 per cent) households three years ago, according to data from the Kenyan National Housing and Population census of 2019.

The situation could be worse, though, as a family lawyer says the government figure is a conservative estimate, and that the number could be as high as seven out of 10 households. ‘‘Just because people are married does not mean they are raising their children as a couple,” she says. “There is a lot of covert single parenting happening in Kenya right now.”

But what specifically is fuelling the rising cases of single parenthood in Kenya? Experts cite a myriad of factors, from premarital childbirth to financial constraints, abuse, lack of orientation to family, intolerance, and even radical feminism.

Worryingly, teenage pregnancy remains a big contributor to the crisis, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) Economic Survey of 2022. The number of teenage mothers, aged between 10 and 19, in the last five years (2017-2021) has topped 1.9 million. This represents an average of 380,000 every year, with the highest number recorded being in 2018, at 449,860.

Even more astonishingly, 106,082 of these are girls aged between 10 and 14. These figures, though, represent only those who went for antenatal care at a health facility.

If that is not bad enough, consider this: the average Kenyan woman has a 59.5 per cent likelihood of being single by the time she is 45, according to a Pan-African study by professors Shelly Clark and Dana Hamplova of McGill University and Charles University, respectively. In this survey, the scholars found out that 30 per cent of Kenyan women were having children out of wedlock, nearly twice as many as their Tanzanian counterparts, at 18 per cent, and six times as their Ethiopian peers, at only five per cent.

Prof Catherine Gachutha, a family therapist, says parenting without a conscious orientation to the essence of a family is to blame for the rise in single parenthood in the country.

‘‘Our generation is not desirous of getting married; they just want to get children and raise them alone. There is lack of commitment to stay in marriage, which is why preference for single parenthood is higher. In this situation, people easily walk out of the marriage when they get disgruntled,” she says.

Then there is the changing role of man in society. Many men are no longer playing the role of provider and leader at home, and this makes women insecure and pushes them away, says Prof Gachutha.

‘‘Many women who can pay school fees, provide for their families’ needs and even property see no value in a man who cannot meet these needs,’’ she says, adding that there is a need to redefine the roles of both men and women in marriage. Anyone can be rendered incapable of providing with job loss, for instance. Where a man is trying to provide but is unable, there should be understanding within the family, says Prof Gachutha.

On leadership, however, she insists that men have no choice but to step up.

‘‘You can attend training to be taught how to dispense leadership and protection of your family. These are roles that are natural to a man, and which will he play through generations. Men and women should not be comfortable in their deficiencies because there are opportunities to make them better spouses.’’

But does radical feminism have anything to do with the rising number of single mothers in Kenya? Prof Gachutha believes so, noting that whether male or female, holding extreme views on family erodes reason and logic while negating realism.

‘‘Extreme views of both feminists and chauvinists catch up with them as they grow older,” she says.

When children are raised by a single father or mother, they grow up with social and psychological inhibitions that affect their worldviews, according to research. This, therefore, is not just a matrimonial matter, but a social one as well.

Also Read: Uhuru fears for surge in single parent families

Studies from various parts of the world show that children brought up by single parents have considerably lower prospects in life compared to their counterparts who are raised by both parents. They are also more inclined to mental health disorders and even crime.

So, what happened to the generation that lived happily ever after? Some people argue that the older generation, namely their parents, put up ‘‘the façade around the myth of marriage considerably well’’ by sitting through abuse and dysfunctionality.

Says Annie Wanjira, a divorcee: ‘‘Human beings evolve continuously and, unfortunately, marriage is not built to last the way it is currently set. People get married too early with unmatched expectations and unequal considerations. The result is that, that institution has become impractical for many young people. It is very damaging to children to grow up in abusive families, for instance, because they grow up modelling abuse and modelling taking abuse.”

Asking women to stay in abusive marriages is immoral, the lawyer says. ‘‘No one should tolerate violence in the name of building a home.’’

While both men and women are raising children as single parents in Kenya, the overwhelming majority of them are single mothers, and Wanjira argues that “most single fathers are actually men who have torn their kids away from their mothers by exploiting loopholes in the judicial system and through corruption” as “it is very unusual for a mother to leave her children behind, especially when they are too young”.

In an interview with this newspaper last year, family lawyer Judy Thongori said divorce has been on the rise in Kenya in recent years. Indeed, data from the Family Division at the High Court at the time showed that the court in Nairobi alone had 15 magistrates presiding over up to five cases per day. Interestingly, the court was processing divorce in a record three months in 2020, an eighth of the normal duration, owing to the high number of petitions. And therefore every day tens of men and women embark on the daunting journey of raising a family alone.

Maryanne Waruguru, a psychologist, says economically empowered women are impatient with a raw deal in marriage and less tolerant with abuse. ‘‘If she feels she cannot put up with some of her husband’s faults, she leaves immediately,’’ she says, noting that her peers in their 30s have become increasingly detached from the concept of marriage.

Waruguru argues that many men and women are compelled to marry simply to ‘‘comply with the rite of passage’’ and not because it is what they want. Soon, things collapse and they end up as single parents.

But if intolerance is straining marriage in Kenya, conflict around resources is further curtailing its chances of survival.

‘‘Many men are not stepping up. They are frustrating women, which is why relationships are not working. The cost of living has become high and children cannot live off empty promises from their fathers,’’ Chebet, a single mother, tells the Nation. To Chebet, it is better to raise a child alone than to have a man who is not dependable.

Money and transparency

Financial expert Samuel Tiras Wainaina notes that disagreement over finance is a major trigger of spousal conflicts, domestic violence and, ultimately, separation.

‘‘Unless there is transparency and participation of the whole family in budgeting family finances, suspicions and mistrust will always emerge. If left unattended for long, this leads to fighting.’’

To Wainaina, there is no ideal formula regarding a couple’s contribution to family budget as it all depends on each person’s abilities. It is important for couples to negotiate and agree on the roles and contribution though. He, however, does not think economic empowerment of women has contributed to failed marriages as “a family is able to achieve bigger life goals faster and easily when both spouses make a contribution” and “financially endowed women make families stable, more secure and happier”.

Wainaina does admit, however, that one of the sociocultural outcomes of empowering women financially has “upset the power dynamics” in the family unit, a consequence he argues was unintended.

‘‘Religion and tradition teach us that the husband is head of family, the provider and protector. Essentially, this gives the man power and so when his wife starts earning more than him, economic power shifts to her as he struggles to assert authority. Naturally, nobody respects authority that has no effective economic power. At this point, many men become violent and file for divorce.’’

Yet family finances should not be an excuse for breakups, notes Wainaina. ‘‘Instead, they should be the umbilical cord that binds everyone through a participatory and transparent process.’’

Wanjiku’s biggest concern is the rising number of single parents around her daughter’s life. ‘‘I have a sister, a cousin and friends who are raising their children as single mothers and others as complete nuclear families. These family dynamics become confusing to her as she is growing up. It becomes difficult to explain to her why this is the case.

She says, however, that the situation has also been a wake-up call to the society “to loosen up” and accept the reality.

‘‘I have not been segregated because I am a single mother. There is even support from both the church and the community I belong to. The church has accepted that we have a problem and is encouraging members to go for counselling and therapy.’’

Under this cloud of intolerance and discomfort, is there hope for the Kenyan family? Experts concur that there is need to relook what constitutes family and the roles of partners. Having a state department on family affairs would be a good place to start, says Prof Gachutha, noting that family is the foundation of nation building, and that having a policy framework is important.

‘‘We can have within the Marriage Act a provision that requires Kenyans to be trained on making families and marriages stronger and more resilient by instilling values. It may not touch on everyone, but some people will benefit.’’

Wainaina says that even though the societal and religious definition of an ‘ideal’ family is that of a man and a wife, the realities of the times are different.

‘‘The patriarchal religious teachings and cultural norms are no longer feasible. A functional family unit is a partnership of willing adults,’’ he says, noting that in-depth research is necessary in this area.

He emphasises the need for discernment and wisdom to navigate the changing landscape of family. Economically empowered women need to manage this newfound power for their marriage to thrive, and men must not feel threatened, challenged or insecure.

Meanwhile, Wanjira argues that the society only starts to heal when ‘‘young people choose authenticity over keeping up appearances’’ to save their marriage. ‘‘This generation is seeking therapy. They are treating things as they are. As such, those growing up now are learning that abuse is not okay. They are redefining family. Both men and women must take responsibility for their offspring instead of having deadbeat mothers and fathers. There must also be mutual respect for roles, considering the evolution of modern living. Only then shall we have progress,’’ she says.

Her circumstances notwithstanding, Wanjiku insists she is a firm believer in marriage and that it works.

“Marriage is the way life is meant to be. It is people who fail, not the marriage.”

By 
Wanja Mbuthia




Mercy Gakii–Muiruri is the head of Investor Relations at Kenya Pension Funds Investment Consortium (KEPFIC), a Consortium of private and public pension schemes that have come together to explore investment opportunities in Infrastructure and alternative investments for better returns and portfolio diversification.

She shares her career path with the Nation.

I’m the head of Investor Relations at Kenya Pension Funds Investment Consortium (KEPFIC). I have 12 years of experience in Pension management, investment banking and insurance. I’m passionate about Pension investments and therefore it gives me much satisfaction to make this contribution in the pension industry.

I’m always eager to give my best and go beyond in whatever I do.

I was born and raised in Kibirichia, Meru County in a family of five.

My father was a college lecturer and an athlete coach while my mother is still a teacher, so I can say I was brought up fairly.

I did my primary school, finished my secondary education at Kaaga Girls which progressed me to the University of Nairobi for a Bachelor of Commerce.

Later on in 2015 I graduated with a Master’s of Science in Finance specializing in Investments. I have the CISI/CMA certification, qualifying me as a client facing investment advisor.

Also Read: Sarah Najmudin - The greatest decision I made was to employ myself

I began my career in 2009 immediately after my undergraduate degree as an intern at Remu MicroFinance where I was the accounts clerk.

Later on, I got a job with Heritage Insurance in the medical department as a finance officer. At first I was in charge of reconciliations and was later promoted to the company’s finance department as an investment analyst where my main role was managing the company’s investments.

In 2015, there was a massive redundancy and I lost my job. Luckily, I had just finished my Master’s degree and over the years I had created awesome networks.

I was able to get consultancy gigs that built my passion for investment management. Within a year I joined African Alliance Investment Bank where I worked with the investment portfolio management team, client relations, business development and investor reporting and relations.

In 2019, I left African Alliance and joined Enwealth Financial Services, a pension administrator as the Regional Business development consultant where I was specifically tasked with launching a new subsidiary in Uganda and heading it.

Due to my family dynamics, I left after 6 months to find a less traveling and local position. I joined PKF Kenya as a business development and strategy manager in Advisory department. My key role was to drive business advisory growth and increase revenue. 

In 2020, Covid hit and business advisory was struggling, so I took a career break after realizing I was expecting my 3rd child. One year break to raise kids was amazing and I was able to bounce back in 2021.

I work with KEPFIC, where we are championing pension schemes to play part in closing the USD 2 billion infrastructure gap in Kenya by investing 10% of their portfolio’s in Infrastructure and Alternative investments as per the Retirement Benefits Authority’s guidelines.

I pride myself in working in a completely new market, heading business entities there and making a difference.

While at African Alliance my colleague in charge of East Africa left for maternity and I had to step in, this was the greatest opportunity in my career because I ended up being assigned to head the business in Uganda and later on being contracted by Enwealth Financial Services to launch for them an office in Uganda and sign in new clients within the first 3 months of existence.

It is the same pride I have currently when I see the impact and influence I have in the pension industry as I drive the consortium’s membership by bringing more pension schemes on board and seeing through the first Infrastructure investments funded by pension schemes in the country.

My husband has always been my number one cheerleader. While doing my masters, he would actually trans night and give me moral support regardless of him being a businessman.

While busy with my work, he steps in helps with the kids. He has always been my personal assistant and advisor in my career.

My Family too - I have disciplined children, an awesome mother, a sister, present and loving mother-in-law, my phone call away niece and my precious house helps. This support is the reason for my growth because I’m always at peace and they push me to be better every day.

While called to travel for work, I am easy (you wouldn’t even know I have a 1-year-old) because of the support I get from my people.

Four years ago, I made a decision to always make a difference in people’s lives and by people I mean strangers.

I took in a girl from a very poor background, she had scored 370 but was the best in those upcountry public school. When I met her, my heart melted. She was bright and focused. I was given the go ahead to take her in. I consider her my first born.

I have mentored her and she has never let me down. She will be sitting her Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams in December. She is an A material and she wants to be a neurosurgeon. She has turned out so good that I pride myself in her so much.

Taking a career break to raise a child. At first I was scared but my hope and confidence came from my supportive spouse. I was expecting my 3rd child and it was not an easy pregnancy as I had to mostly be bedridden and on bed rest.

This break gave me time to reflect and refresh on my career path, I was able to exclusively breastfeed my baby. After my health got better, I was able to start job hunting processes and finally what was meant for me happened.

I’m the head of Investor Relations and membership outreach at Kenya Pension Funds Investment Consortium (KEPFIC).

I am responsible leading pension funds in Kenya into sustainable infrastructure and alternative investments investing.

My job entails Investor Relations and membership management, developing strategies for the department, performance tracking and reporting, communications and marketing, capacity building support.

Let us learn to save. I know things are tight but let us prioritize our needs and let us not compare our needs to others.

Don’t pressure yourself trying to impress your peers. Walk at your pace and you will make it.

Then, if you work in an organization that has a pension scheme, please take interest to understand the investments that your scheme has invested in.

This is your future so take control and run for those trustee positions, we need the younger generation in those boardrooms too.

Oh yes! We just began this big movement that I intend to grow. Private sector financing infrastructure projects in the country. Kenya can be self-reliable and this is my wish and my passion is to see this career wish come true.

In life, am already done with kids so my plan is to give them the best.

I love working out - I do gym 5 times a week. I hike and take part in different work-out challenges or bucket list programs.

I am not perfect but I consider my past the greatest contribution to what I am today. I am what I am today because of my imperfect past. I have grown and I thank my past for this.

190,News,"Zebras at Samburu national reserve


By 
Rupi Mangat






Within minutes of entering the main gate at Archer’s Post, Julius Lesori,our Samburu driver-guide asks the group of women on safari with Girls Guide to Paris & Beyond, “Which is your favourite animal?”



He’s got a twinkle in his eye, waiting for that answer to make a wish come true.



The women respond with a magnitude of Africa’s animals: elephants, lion, leopard, giraffe…until one lady goes: “Cheetah…I want to see cheetahs.”

CHEETAH MUM AND HER CUBS AT SAMBURU NATIONAL RESERVE Photo | Pool



In the next few minutes of Samburu’s savannah-filled heat-resilient thorny acacias, commiphoras and the pink-flowered radiant Desert Rose, Julius meanders the safari cruiser to a standstill. Camouflaged against the earthy soil under a scrawny acacia is the spotted sphinx and her four fluff balls. We draw our breath in, to be in the presence of one of the big cats – and one that is increasingly on the decline – the cheetah.



The feline is resting but her topaz eyes alert. Her month-old cubs suck on her teats, chase each other, climb on her but never wander away. We are alone with her. Behind her, a kilometre away is the river on whose bank is our abode for the night, Elephant Bedroom Camp.



It’s November and the short rains in the northern drylands are late. The grass is parched and the Ewaso Nyiro, that is the life-lung of this arid land, a thin shallow flow, her banks glistening with sand. But she is the magnet that attracts the creatures of the wild to her shores to quench their thirst.

Lions at Samburu Nation reserve



Mary Wykstra of Action for Cheetahs in Kenya (ACK not to be confused with the church) gives an insight to the spotted sphinx in today’s rapidly changing world. “The Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo, Meru regions are the largest area of connected cheetah population within Kenya,” tells the scientist studying cheetahs outside protected areas. 

According to the cheetah woman, these cats share space with people. In Kenya which is a cheetah stronghold, almost 80 percent live outside of the protected areas. That cheetahs are declining at a rate of 2.1 percent annually across their range means that we have to be smart about conserving the last of the wild. 

It’s possible according to the cheetah scientist. “If the government and NGOs work together, using science and technology to plan development that includes underpasses, overpasses, considers wildlife and livestock migratory routes, and at the same time provide all that is needed to bring infrastructure to rural communities.”

Despite the drought, our game drives are exciting. The lions snooze in the bushes, a pair of Silver-backed Jackals has hunted a dikdik, and herds of elephants coated in red dust file past us, gingerly kicking the remaining straws of grass loose with their mighty feet, to put into their mouths with their long trunks. A playful calf oblivious of the drought, imitates the older elephants, kicking clumps of dry grass but almost trips. Then the baby has a go with its trunk at picking the grass off the ground and twirling it to its mouth. The grass falls. Unperturbed, the calf finds this a playful venture knowing that the mother is close when it wants to suckle.

Like human babies, elephant babies also need to practice coordination.

Samburu’s wildlife is spectacular, the reserve a microcosm for the wildlife. The handsome Beisa oryx with long, sharp horns and a beautiful patterned face that resemble a pharaoh’s mask graze in the higher hills of ancient stone in the wake of Ol Lolokwe, the sacred mountain of the Samburu. Fine stripes appear.

It’s a herd of grevy's zebra, now increasingly rare like the spotted sphinx. With only 3,000 Grevy’s zebra left in the wild, Sheila Funnel of Grevy’s Zebra Trust accompanying us talks about the work of GTZ. “We are the only organisation that is 100 percent dedicated to Grevy’s zebra conservation in Kenya,” she states.

The corner stone of GTZ’s work is partnering with the pastoralist communities living alongside the Grevy's zebra with projects like regenerating grasslands vital for both livestock and the rare equid.

Between exciting game drives at sunrise and sunset to catch the magical golden light, there’s diva time for sumptuous dining and invigorating massages in the sensual space that is Samburu. 



Safari to Samburu

320 kilometres of Nairobi, you can either fly or drive. The upmarketElephant Bedroom Camp is on the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro, with elephants browsing around.

Nation Media Group



Safaricom has been allocated a prime internet spectrum for its fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology network, pushing it closer to rolling out commercial superfast internet.

Insiders told the Nation that the telco got a 60 megahertz (MHz) spectrum in the 2600MHz band from the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA).

“The 2600MHz band is very prime, it was previously used by the security agencies in Kenya but they released it following change in the technology that they use,” a senior source said. The source did not disclose the amount the telco paid for the spectrum.

Read:  Kenya most expensive in East Africa in mobile internet affordability index

The price is certainly higher than the $25 million (Sh2.89billion) licence fee for the 4G internet spectrum about five years ago.

Safaricom did not respond to queries on its 5G rollout plans when contacted.

China’s Huawei, which built Safaricom’s 5G network, has in other markets such as Thailand, preferred the 2600MHz band because it allows operators to install base transmission stations – commonly referred to as cell towers – for heavy data traffic nationwide.

Read: Why 5G grid matters

The allocated spectrum marks a major step forward for Safaricom, which like other telcos, is eager to formally roll out 5G and reap from the rising demand for superfast internet.

The country’s main telcos, Airtel and Safaricom have already done extensive trials on 5G from hundreds of sites spread across the country.

Airtel Kenya has over 600 sites in Nairobi, Mombasa, and Malindi in its pilot 5G network as it prepares to compete for a larger share of the fast-growing data business.

Safaricom has piloted 5G networks in several counties including Nairobi, Kisumu and Kisii, and seeks to expand the high-speed internet to more urban areas.

Read: Kenya backs Safaricom, Huawei 5G rollout deal

The regulator has stepped up preparations for the 5G rollout and disclosed that some of its fixed wireless access (FWA) network infrastructure – which operators use to deliver ultra-high-speed broadband to suburban and rural areas where fibre is prohibitively expensive to lay and maintain – would be converted to support 5G technology by the end of June.

“The authority issues frequency assignments to network facilities providers to deploy network infrastructure and provide connectivity to consumers typically within the 1.7, 3.3, and 3.5 GHz (gigahertz) bands. The 3.5 GHz band, within which most FWA deployments have been activated in Kenya, will be re-farmed from fixed wireless access to mobile wireless access for 5G technology by June 30, 2022” the regulator said in an update on the allocation of frequencies for the three months ended March.

The date of the formal rollout of the 5G network, however, remains unclear despite pressure from telcos.

Barely 10 days ago, the regulator rejected a request by Safaricom to expedite the rollout of the 5G network.

Insiders said authorities are particularly concerned that a rushed shift to 5G poses the risk of excluding a large chunk of consumers who lack the appropriate gear to support the technology.

Subscribers who want to use the superfast internet have to acquire handsets compatible with 5G to enjoy the service, which offers much faster data download and upload speeds that ultimately ease network congestion.

The prices of smartphones that support 5G technology are still prohibitive in Kenya.

188,News,"View from the bottom of the Wayando Beach Eco Lodge's garden.


By 
John Fox




There was no need to decorate a tree or roast a turkey this Christmas; both our sons were away. My wife suggested that we should explore a part of Kenya we had never visited – Rusinga Island on Lake Victoria and the nearby Ruma National Park.

On our Google search for accommodation on the island, the Wayando Beach Eco Lodge looked promising. It proved to be an excellent choice. 

But, first, there was the drive. Our satnav lady estimated it would take six hours; it took us eight. She hadn’t reckoned on the mindless driving down the Escarpment to Mai Mahiu. Every time there was a gap in the oncoming traffic, drivers started to overtake.

At one point there were four lanes going down. Inevitably, there was a gridlock. It happened twice, and that’s where we lost most of the two hours. Then it was on to Narok, through Sotik, Kisii and Homa Bay to Mbita and its splendid causeway to Rusinga Island.

The lodge is on the north shoreline, only four kilometres from the causeway. It has five imaginatively decorated and self-contained rondavels. They have electricity, composting sawdust toilets and showers. We were warned that the shower water in our banda was cold, but there are separate hot showers a short walk away across the grass. 

The lawn is dotted with fruit trees; some of them slung with hammocks. It leads down to the lake and a dramatic view of the small Ngodhe Island. Always, it seems, there are lateen sail fishing boats drifting by. 

The owner, Linda Okatch Mungayaka, is from the US. Her husband was one of the wave of young Kenyans airlifted for scholarships there arranged by Tom Mboya. When Okatch was senselessly killed in some Kansas street violence, Linda decided to come to Kenya to make an African home for her two-year old son. That home is now the Eco Lodge, which she opened in 2011. The rondavel we were staying in is the one her son uses when he visits from the States. 

Linda showed us round. She is rightly proud of the large kitchen garden she has created according to principles of permaculture. The soil is bulked up with mulch from fallen leaves, grass clippings and compost from the sawdust in the bucket toilets that are emptied every day.

There is a clever watering system, also – a pattern of small-scale dams and channels. All this feeds a wide variety of edible plants and vegetables, which means that much of the food served in the restaurant is home grown and fresh. 

Linda is a very attentive cook. There is no fixed menu for the daily buffet, and she asks what her guests like. While we were there, the range of dishes included rice, ugali from sorghum, potato chips, Thai papaya salad, green salad with apples, banana pancakes, fried chicken, tilapia and Nile perch in various ways, chapatis with shredded carrots. The coffee was special, too —  grown locally in Rongo. 

There is a delightful dawn chorus of birds, because the garden is home for many species. A pair of hamerkops had built their layered nest in a tree right outside our banda. There were a number of raucous plantain-eaters, I had seen before only in Ugandan woodlands. The most striking bird was the black-headed gonolek, unmistakable with his scarlet belly. Every day, a line of pied kingfishers perched on the boundary wires and watched the waters of the lake. 

The staff seem to have been with Linda from the beginning. Sam Okudo knows all the garden birds and plants. Blasto Okomo seems to know everything about the place – and about the whole of Rusinga Island. With Linda, they run a welcoming, restful and a fascinating lodge. 

Half board is Sh5,900 per person. You can camp there, too. But for more information you can go to www.wayandoecolodge.com or ring 0723 773571.

Peter Kiptanui did not survive three years post-retirement. Although he had been earning in job group N in the civil service, his retirement payout was a dismal Sh. 13,000 per month which was not enough to sustain the lifestyle he was used to. Life became expensive and he relocated to his rural home in Kapsabet where he became a herder. Weighed down by the loss of friends, income, and the change of lifestyle, Peter grew weary and old. He died in November 2019, two and half years after retirement.

Peter’s story illustrates the importance of having a retirement plan. A workable retirement plan will safeguard your future, the future of your family, and help maintain your quality of life when you retire.

How do you plan for retirement?

Retirement age

Decide the age and type of lifestyle you want to lead once you retire. Godwin Simba, the Group Executive Director at Octagon Africa says that you should estimate how much you’ll need and begin with 80 percent of your present living expenses. Your retirement lifestyle will depend on your present contributions. There are online financial calculators such as the CalcXML you can use to estimate how much you should save from your annual pay at your current age to attain your desired retirement figure.

Inflation

The money you think you should save today may not be of equal value in the next 15 to 20 years. The lifestyle you are living today will cost you more in ten years due to inflation. If you are planning to retire within the next 20 years, you must create a plan that will give you an income that is close to what you are earning today to ensure that your income replacement rate is as stable as possible. “If you are earning Sh. 100,000 today, you will need at least Sh. 60,000 coming into your account every end month at age 55 to ensure that your lifestyle adjustment is not drastic,” says Simba.

Types of schemes

You can opt for pension schemes or provident funds. With a pension scheme, your contribution and your employer’s contribution plus the accrued interest shall be used to buy a pension policy. When you retire, the insurance will pay you a specific amount of money every year. With provident funds, you will get paid in a lump sum similar to a golden handshake. Simba cautions that lump sum payments are easier to misuse. “Cash lump sums paid by pension schemes are usually exhausted in the first three years,” he says.

Consultancy in retirement

If you are a professional, you can transfer your skills into a consultancy after retirement. This is easier than using your retirement money to start a business. This will also earn you additional income beyond your monthly or annual life insurance payout while you keep busy and active. For example, if you work in a financial institution’s credit department, start thinking of how you can gain skills that you can repackage into a consultancy helping SMEs get access to credit after retirement. If you are an investment advisor, start planning to become a personal finance or investment consultant upon retirement.

Mental health

After retirement, you will experience loss of a stable work routine, you’ll lose regular friends, get overwhelmed with boredom, and fear that your place as an authority in society and family is diminishing. “These sudden losses can be too much to process. They can lead to bad emotional and financial decisions with far-reaching mental repercussions,” says Ken Munyua, a psychologist. “The best way to guard yourself is to keep your health in check and to find a professional who can walk with you.”




Other risk factors include the breaking up of a family, a blended family, and financial disturbances such as a job loss or getting auctioned.


Unlike breaking up an ordinary relationship, a divorce not only breaks up love, promises and hopes, it also breaks families apart. 


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.


From 25 per cent households headed by a single parent in 2009, the number had shot to a staggering four out of 10 three years ago

“If you want to avoid prostate cancer, have sex with multiple women!” This is one of the commonly peddled myths about prostate cancer. Hot on its heels is the claim that only men who have few sexual relations get prostate cancer. In June 2019, scandalous preacher Gilbert Deya confessed that he had cheated on his wife in order to avoid getting prostate cancer.

Just what is the link between prostate cancer and sex and how will it affect your sex life?

Penile reduction

Although most men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer have a high chance of surviving, this cancer has a direct bearing on your sex life. A study conducted by the Harvard Medical School found that one may suffer a reduced penis size after surgery or radiotherapy. The penile reduction was also common in men with recurrent prostate cancer and was attributed to nerve and blood vessel damage. Apart from sustaining reduced penile size, you may also sustain erectile dysfunction.

Erectile dysfunction

Radical prostatectomy (the surgical procedure for complete removal of the prostate) is the cause of most erectile problems during treatment. It may take you three months to three years to regain your erections after going through this surgical procedure. If you undergo radiotherapy, your erectile problems could last for up to two years. “Men who have hormone therapy or radiotherapy might also produce less to no semen, resulting in dry orgasms or retrograde ejaculation,” says the oncology medical journal of Cancer Research. After treatment, if you are still able to make an erection, you may find that erections and ejaculations are painful. The pain is due to internal bruises and the inflammation of the urethra that is caused by radiotherapy and will go away after a few weeks.

Low confidence

If you suffer erectile dysfunction or reduced penis size, your confidence and desire for sexual intercourse could reduce. However, no damage is irreparable if you are willing to see the right health professionals. These include your oncologist, urologist, sexologist, and physiotherapist or clinical psychologist. Psychologist Patrick Musau says that the road to recovery and regaining your sexual prowess should begin in your mind. “To have a balanced recovery, your mentality needs to come to terms with your diagnosis, treatment, and recovery therapy,” he says. This doesn’t mean that you should shun romance. Stay positive by introducing new ways of getting intimate that do not necessarily entail direct intercourse. “Kiss and cuddle as regularly as possible, have candle-lit dinners, take baths together and go to bed together to maintain and enhance your intimacy,” he says.

Demystifying myths

Quick takeaways




Risk factors include having a family history of prostate cancer, eating a poor diet, especially meals with inadequate micronutrients.


Vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities.

184,News,"Elon Musk. Twitter has proposed to use a so-called ""poison pill"" against his potential hostile takeover of Twitter.


By 
AFP




The so-called ""poison pill"" Twitter has proposed to use against Elon Musk's potential hostile takeover is a mechanism with a proven track record that could force the outspoken entrepreneur into negotiations.

To halt a takeover, the board plans to activate the pill if the Tesla CEO comes to own more than 15 percent of Twitter.

He already holds 9.2 percent of the company, and said Thursday he has ready the $46.5 billion necessary to make an offer for the rest.

Such a ""pill"" would allow other Twitter shareholders to purchase shares at half price, increasing the amount of shares in circulation and weakening Musk's influence.

It would then be nearly impossible for him to take total control of the company without having to spend significantly more than he had originally planned.

""The dilution created by this defense has generally served its intended deterrence effect,"" explained Eric Wehrly, associate professor of finance at Western Washington University.

The ""poison pill"" was invented 40 years ago by business lawyer Martin Lipton to counteract a wave of hostile takeovers on Wall Street.

""It was the age of the corporate raiders,"" Lipton explained to the media site The Deal in 2011, from investors such as Carl Icahn to Kirk Kerkorian.

Also Read: Elon Musk no longer joining Twitter board

Quickly contested in court, the practice was declared legal for the first time in 1985 by the Delaware Supreme Court -- a tax friendly state where Twitter, although officially based in California, is incorporated.

""Delaware is the home to roughly half of publicly traded companies in the US and has fairly well established law regarding the implementation of poison pills,"" said Jon Karpoff, a finance professor at the University of Washington.

""Unless there's something unusual about Twitter's pill, which I would highly doubt... Musk would be unlikely to have a successful legal challenge,"" he said.

Boston College associate law professor Brian Quinn doesn't think the issue will even end up in court.

""Elon Musk has no case,"" he said.

An alternative to acquiring the majority of the company would be for Musk to change the makeup of the board, according to Quinn, installing new members more in line with his vision for Twitter.

But the agenda for Twitter's next general meeting, on May 25, is already set, meaning Musk would have to wait until the next general meeting in 2023 to even bring it up.

And the board of directors can only be removed in batches, anyways.

Some members' terms are up this year, while others will remain in their position until 2023, 2024 or 2025.

Musk wouldn't be able to win over a majority of the board until at least 2024.

According to Quinn, ""there's no record of an acquirer overcoming the pill by replacing the board through two successive elections.""

""The only option for an acquirer is to negotiate with the board of directors,"" Quinn said, presumably by proposing an even higher offer, but without any guarantee of success.

And in the event of a negotiation, Musk wouldn't be able to count on the support of former Twitter head and co-founder Jack Dorsey, unless there is a quick resolution.

Dorsey, who has previously expressed affinity for the billionaire, announced after his resignation in November that he would not run for another term as director and would step down after this year's meeting.

In tandem with the official negotiations, Musk would have to start making his case to shareholders, according to Karpoff, a task which has already begun -- mainly by tweeting.

""And I think his personal popularity among a lot of people will help them in that,"" Karpoff said.

""I wouldn't be surprised if we even got a bunch of retail investors involved in struggling to acquire Twitter shares, and joining the attempt to pressure board members to strike a deal with Musk.""

French World Cup-winning midfielder Paul Pogba is to leave Manchester United at the end of June, the club said Wednesday, bringing the curtain down on a largely disappointing second spell.

The 29-year-old's departure at the end of his contract will see United recoup none of the then record £89 million ($112 million) he cost them when they bought him from Juventus in 2016.

However, new United manager Erik ten Hag has clearly decided Pogba's chances at the club have come and gone.

A second spell at Juventus -- where he won four Serie A titles -- may well be on Pogba's menu as Italian media have suggested he has given a verbal agreement to return and accepted a lower salary.

French champions Paris Saint-Germain have also been mentioned as a possibility as they are due for an overhaul and built round his fellow World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe.

Ten Hag wishes to refresh a side that has seen their city rivals Manchester City become the powerhouse they once were under Alex Ferguson. United have rarely threatened to repeat those days since he retired in 2013.

Pogba flourished initially under Jose Mourinho -- who also brought in the since departed Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Romelu Lukaku -- and was part of the sides that won the League Cup and Europa League in 2017.

His subsequent performances rarely matched those he produced for France in their 2018 World Cup campaign.

He did show glimpses of his abundant talent especially in their run to the 2021 Europa League final -- scoring goals against AC Milan and Roma in the knockout stages.

However, he was then anonymous in the final as United lost to Villarreal on penalties.

Fitness problems limited him to 27 appearances last season in an unimpressive campaign for both player and club as United had to be content with a Europa League spot.

The fans had lost patience with his inconsistent displays and booed him off the pitch when he was substituted in a victory over Norwich in April.

""The club can announce that Paul Pogba will leave Manchester United at the end of June, upon the expiry of his contract,"" read the club statement.

""The last of his 233 United games ended in the 10th minute of a defeat at Anfield in April 2022.

""It was a low-key end to a United career that brought so many individual high moments.

""So many beautiful goals, assists and pieces of skill.

""For a boy that joined the Academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated.""

Brazilian football legend Pele called Wednesday for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his army's invasion of Ukraine, as the war-torn country's national team was set to vie for a World Cup spot.

""Today Ukraine tries to forget, at least for 90 minutes, the tragedy that still engulfs their country,"" Pele wrote in an open letter to Putin, posted on Instagram just before the Ukrainian men's football team faced Scotland in a World Cup playoff semi-final.

""I want to use today's match as an opportunity to make a request: stop the invasion. There is absolutely no justification for this continued violence,"" added the three-time World Cup champion.

""This conflict is wicked, unjustifiable and brings nothing but pain, fear, terror and anguish... Wars only exist to separate nations, and there's no ideology that justifies projectile missiles burying the dreams of children, ruining families and killing the innocent.""

Pele recalled meeting Putin in the past and exchanging ""smiles accompanied by a long handshake.""

""The power to stop this conflict is in your hands. The same ones I shook in Moscow, at our last meeting in 2017,"" he wrote.

Considered by many the greatest footballer of all time, Pele had one of the most storied careers in sport, scoring more than 1,000 goals before retiring in 1977.

He has been in poor health recently, undergoing surgery last September for a colon tumor, followed by ongoing chemotherapy.

His message comes as the Ukraine conflict nears its 100th day, with fierce fighting ongoing in the nation's east, after the Russian army failed in its bid to overtake Kyiv.

The match in Glasgow is the first for the Ukrainian national team since the invasion began.

The winners will face Wales on Sunday to decide who will be the final member of Group B -- alongside England, the United States and Iran.

Nation Media Group



Kenya Police winger Clifton Miheso is optimistic that he will beat KCB forward Derrick Otanga in the Golden Boot race as the Football Kenya Federation Premier League (FKF-PL) enters its penultimate round of matches.

Miheso, who scored two goals in their 2-1 win over Posta Rangers at Ruaraka grounds over the weekend, has 14 goals, one shy of Otanga who tops the scoring charts.

Otanga, who has been in superb form this season despite KCB’s poor run, didn’t get a goal over the weekend as the bankers lost by a solitary goal to Nzoia Sugar at Sudi Stadium in Bungoma.

However, Miheso is confident that he can add to this tally when they host relegation candidates Vihiga Bullets this weekend and title chasing Bandari away in their last two matches.

“I’m up for the Golden Boot fight and I will fight to score so as to win this prestigious prize. As a team, we have struggled this season and the Golden Boot will ensure we have something to celebrate,” said Miheso.

The 29-year-old winger says he would have scored many goals this season, but sometimes being played out of position has minimised his chances.

“I don’t want to blame the technical bench, but when I was deployed as a false nine, I scored many goals because I didn’t have to fall back and help in defending. However, as a player, I have to follow instructions because even if another player scores, it is the team that benefits,” said Miheso.

Since his appointment as the team’s head coach in March this year, Sammy ‘Pamzo’ Omollo has always deployed Elvis Rupia and Clinton Kinanga in the central striking position with Miheso relegated to the flank.

However, it will be a tall order for either Miheso and Otanga to hit the 24 goal mark attained by former Kariobangi Sharks striker Eric Kapaito, who is currently plying his trade in Ethiopia.

Otanga has only one game to add to his goal tally when the bankers clash with Bidco United in their final game of the season.

KCB were scheduled to play Mathare United this weekend, but the latter have already been relegated after missing their matches against Sofapaka, Ulinzi Stars and Bandari.

180,News,"Degenerative disc disease is a condition that occurs when the discs in the spine begin to break down.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Did you know that over two-thirds of women will experience some form of lower back pain in their lifetime?

There are a number of causes of lower back pain in women including pregnancy and poor posture. Whatever the cause, there are treatment options available to alleviate the pain and get you back on your feet.

One often-overlooked cause of lower back pain is poor posture. Maintaining good posture requires muscles throughout the body, including those in the back and abdomen. When these muscles are not adequately supported, they can become fatigued, leading to pain and stiffness.

Additionally, poor posture can put undue strain on the spine, resulting in misalignment and further pain.

Solution: Exercises to strengthen the supporting muscles, as well as stretches to increase flexibility. By improving posture, it is possible to find relief from lower back pain.

Injuries or trauma to the back is a common cause of lower back pain. These can range from minor sprains and strains to more severe conditions such as herniated discs or fractured vertebrae.

Many times, these injuries occur due to sudden movements or unexpected impacts. However, they can also develop over time due to repetitive motions.

If you have suffered an injury to your back, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Depending on the severity of the injury, you may need to rest and ice the area, wear a supportive brace, or undergo physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary.

Sitting for extended periods can put a lot of strain on the lower back. This is because the position puts pressure on the spine and limited movement can lead to muscle stiffness.

Over time, this can lead to inflammation and pain. In addition, sitting for long periods can lead to weight gain, which puts additional strain on the lower back.

By making a few simple changes, you can ease lower back pain caused by a sedentary lifestyle. For example, taking regular breaks to move around and stretch can keep the muscles and joints mobile.

In addition, regular exercise can strengthen the muscles and improve flexibility. Finally, maintaining a healthy weight will help to reduce the amount of strain on the lower back.

Lower back pain is a common complaint during pregnancy. There are a number of reasons why pregnancy can cause lower back pain. First, the extra weight of the growing baby puts strain on the muscles and ligaments in the back. As the baby grows, the centre of gravity shifts forward, putting even more stress on the back.

During the last few months of pregnancy, the hormone relaxin is released to prepare the body for childbirth. Unfortunately, this hormone relaxes the ligaments and joints, leading to instability and pain in the lower back.

Solution: Exercise, proper posture, wearing flat shoes, massage, and supportive clothing can help minimize discomfort. Additionally, your doctor may suggest over-the-counter or prescription medication to help manage pain.

Degenerative disc disease is a condition that occurs when the discs in the spine begin to break down. This can happen due to normal wear and tear.

When the discs degenerate, they lose their ability to cushion and support the spine. This can lead to pain, stiffness, and decreased mobility.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the problem. However, many nonsurgical treatment options can help relieve pain and improve function. These include physical therapy, exercises, and medications.

Preventive measures for lower back pain include:


Treatment options for back pain include exercise, chiropractic care massage therapy acupuncture, and surgery.


Sensitive body parts in men include the elbow, knew, fingerprints, and the shin.

Africa's 100m record holder Ferdinand Omanyala will not compete at Tuesday's World Athletics Continental Tour Gold at the Golden Spike in Ostrava, Czech Republic.

Omanyala Monday said he had withdrawn from the Golden Spike, opting to shift his focus on the Africa Senior Athletic Championships scheduled for June 8 to 12 at Cote d’Or National Sports Complex in Reduit, Mauritius.

Omanyala’s manager Marcel Viljoen said that his athlete suffered abdominal strain while in training after his last race on Wednesday in Germany, hence didn’t want to aggravate it with more races.

Golden Spike Ostrava race director Alfons Juck confirmed Omanyala’s withdrawal. “Yes, I was told he is injured. He skipped other meet before too,” said Juck.

“We were concerned about some niggle when he was doing his starts. We decided it is not worth the risk with only less than two weeks to the African Championships,” explained Viljoen. “He is back home to have it treated.”

Viljoen regretted Omanyala missing out on a great opportunity to race against a star-studded field at Ostrava.

“Right Omanyala is feeling good and looking forward to participating on the continent’s biggest stage for the first time, his first big outdoor Championships of the year,” said Viljoen.

“All is well and I now want to preserve my energies for the Africa event,” said Omanyala, who is back in the country from Europe where he competed in three 100m and one 200m races.

On his return to Europe after his indoor debut in 60m in February, Omanyala clocked 10.11sec to win the Castiglione International Meeting at Stadio Zecchini in Grosseto, Italy on May 22.

He went on to win the 200m second heat in a personal best of 20.50sec at the same meeting.

Omanyala then moved to Germany where he won the 100m second heat in 10.23 se,  but finished second in the final in 10.14sec at the Internationales Leichtathletik Meeting at Paul-Greifzu-Stadion on Wednesday.

Omanyala was to compete in his second meeting in Germany last weekend but failed to start.

Omanyal was to face off with his idol, Jamaican Yohan Blake. Omanyala has the fastest 100m time field this year of 9.85 sec he attained when he won the Kip Keino Classic on May 7 at the Moi International Sports Centre. Kasarani.

However, the decorated Yohan, a two-time Olympic champion and two-time world champion,  is the fastest in the field with a personal best of 9.69 sec clocked in Lausanne, Switzerland in 2012.

Meanwhile, World Under 20 800m champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi will go head-to-head with  Botswana’s 2012 Olympic silver medallist Nijel Amos and Bosnian two-time world medallist Amel Tuka.

Wanyonyi will be eying his second Gold Tour victory after winning at Kip Keino Classic in 1:45.01.

Also in the 800m field is Poland’s Olympic bronze medallist Patryk Dobe and Max Burgin, who returns to the scene of his European Under-20 800m record of 1:44.14 set a year ago.

Ethiopia’s Diribe Welteji, who also won in Nairobi in 4:01.50, will be at the centre of the women’s 1,500m.

She expects an easy sail against Poland’s European silver medallist Sofia Ennaoui, multiple Czech record-holder Kristiina Maki and Britain’s European indoor and Commonwealth medallist Melissa Courtney-Bryant.

Ethiopia’s Olympic silver medallist Lamecha Girma headlines the men’s 3,000m steeplechase. He was second on his season opener at the Diamond League meeting in Doha and will look to go one better in Ostrava.

US sprint legend Allyson Felix takes to the track in the 200m, while world champions Tom Walsh and Joe Kovacs go to head-to-head in shot put and home javelin stars Jakub Vadlejch and Vitezslav Vesely take on the in-form Anderson Peters.

Jasmine Camacho-Quinn stars in another strong 100m hurdles field and her fellow Tokyo gold medallist Gianmarco Tamberi leads the line-up for the men’s high jump

178,News,"The cover page of Richard Kioko Kiundi’s memoir, ‘Through the Wilderness of Life: The Duke of Emali.’


Prime



By 
Tom Odhiambo




To read some books is like listening to a spring race commentary. Some stories are so fast paced even on the pages of a book that one is left wondering how they would be told by word of mouth.

This is the easiest way to describe Richard Kioko Kiundi’s memoir, Through the Wilderness of Life: The Duke of Emali (Afritell Publishers, 2022). This is one book that the reader has to keep pace with the storyteller’s race. It reads more like an adventure story on a journey that will most likely not end.

Indeed life can be a wilderness as the title of Kioko’s story suggests. If one adds the image of Emali to the story, one begins to understand how the idea of life as a wilderness may have appeared to Kioko. One can imagine growing up in the area around what is today Emali at the time Kioko was born. 

What could he have been seeing except an expanse of land full of shrubs, trees and wildlife? What would have been the dream of a young person in such a place but to walk and walk to beyond what the eye could see? Such dreams of adventure would define one’s life forever.

Thus, Kioko’s story is one long adventure that leaves the reader suspecting that what is in the book is only but a small part of the longer version. 

Kioko was born in the “village of Kwakakulu in the then Iteta location of Masaku colonial district, now Makueni County” on March 20, 1959. His parents had nine children. 

He was the eighth child to Danson Kiundu Yambu and Serah Mbuve Kiundu. He says that he was mostly raised by his elder sister, Esther Ndunge, who fed, bathed and generally looked after him. 

Kioko would go to primary school in his village before being admitted to Alliance High School and then University of Nairobi, from where he graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Commerce, Accounting Option.

Through the Wilderness of Life is hardly a linear story even though it takes the reader from Kwakakulu to Nairobi, where Kioko lives today, with sojourns in Kilifi and Taveta where he worked as a civil servant. 

The nonlinear plot seems deliberate. It is as if the storyteller is suggesting that life is merely a collection of experiences, which can be captured in anecdotes; as if to imply that there is no really one big story that can define any human being. 

Which is why this autobiography reads like a collection of sketches thrown together with the reader left to decide which one to enjoy most.

For the Alliance School alumni and those interested in the school, there are several tales about Kioko’s time at the school. He memorializes his alma mater quite well by celebrating the teachers who taught him and those who headed the institution from its birth to the time of writing his book. 

There is a lesson here for the millions of individuals out there who passed through schools and whose lives were shaped by teachers but who hardly have much to say about their former schools. 

But Kioko’s is also a story of escapades by young men in school – trying out smoking, alcohol and endless interest in the young women. But Kioko still managed to pass his ‘A’ level exams and go to the university.

Kioko’s work life begins in Kilifi where he was posted as a District Accountant just before graduating from the university. He describes his time in Kilifi as some kind of adventure, where he made friends, indulged in weekend parties and seemed to enjoy his work.

However, he seemed to have fallen afoul of some District Commissioner, which eventually led to his posting to Taita Taveta District. 

He would leave the civil service in 1987 when he was offered a job at the Motor Mart Group, then a part of the Lonrho multinational corporation. 

Kioko left the Motor Mart Group voluntarily in 1995.

He would immediately thereafter join the Kenya Pipeline Corporation where he worked till 2002. 

Kioko was dismissed from KPC allegedly for being responsible for ‘forgery and loss of company money’ by employees who claimed subsistence allowance for work that was not done. 

Kioko says that he wasn’t given a fair chance to defend himself. When he took his former employers to court, he lost the case. Was he a victim of workplace vindictiveness or was he just an innocent man caught in the shady deals that happen all the time in some public corporations?

Kioko’s story is one of resilience. He has weathered job losses. He has lost investments and money to friends and conmen. He has lost family members but has had to live with the death of a beloved son. 

He has endured the pain of suffering from cancer, which he managed to beat. These experiences seem to have taught him very personal lessons, which he captures in the ‘reflections’ at the end of the memoir.

He says, “I have also learnt that there is no absolute truth and that no one entity holds the key to knowledge. All in all, however, I have learnt to live and let live expecting reciprocal treatment as well. In the end, I follow my conscience and do to others what I would expect to be done to me under the same circumstances. I can say with confidence that I have been set free to live my life in the best way I know how, without looking over my shoulder.” 

Through the Wilderness of Life: The Duke of Emali is a story that rivals many self-help and motivational books. 

For here is a story of a man who shows incredible belief in his abilities and a desire to succeed all the time. 

Although the reader is left wondering if what is behind the set of the story told so far isn’t longer and more interesting, what Kioko offers is a captivating medley of anecdotes that takes the reader through the rough ride that is life. As to how Kioko became the ‘Duke of Emali’, find out from the book itself.

Having lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade, Netflix faces the new challenge of stagnation from a position of strength.

A drop of just 200,000 users -- less than 0.1 percent of its total customer base -- was enough to send Wall Street panicking, with shares plunging more than 30 percent on Wednesday.

The loss of subscribers and the company's various plans to revive business ""change the historically simple story"" of Netflix's solid success, said Wells Fargo analysts, who cut its price target in half.

""The new outlook is clear as mud,"" they said.

If the Q1 loss of subscribers might seem a blip at first blush, Netflix is signaling otherwise: The company anticipates a much larger drop in its second quarter -- of around two million net subscribers.

""I'm not sure that's a turning point"" for Netflix, said Scott Zari of S&P Global Ratings.

""But I think it is indicative of maybe a new phase of slower growth,"" he said.

Also Read: CNN+ shows why flexibility is key in news business

Bank of America analysts said in a note that Netflix ""made it clear that we can expect very low subscriber growth in '22 and '23 with no margin expansion.""

The shift was felt even in the tone of the company's results presentation on Tuesday evening.

The affair focused less on the streamer's mega hits such as ""Bridgerton"" and ""Ozark"" and more on combating the 100 million households who watch Netflix for free thanks to shared passwords.

""When we were growing fast, it wasn't the high priority to work on,"" co-founder Reed Hastings admitted. ""And now we're working super hard on it.""

Chief operating officer Gregory Peters said Netflix wasn't trying to shut down sharing, ""but we're going to ask you to pay a bit more to be able to share.""

According to Zari, ""future growth will be dependent on how can they monetize those households.""

To attract viewers, Netflix is preparing cheaper subscriptions with advertising -- which it expects to roll out in the next couple years.

The Los Gatos, California-based company has long defended its no-ads model, which set it apart from competitors such as Disney+, HBO Max and Apple.

Also Read: Kenya filmmaker pockets Sh11m from Netflix

For Pivotal analyst Jeff Wlodarczak, streaming ""appears nearly fully penetrated globally post-Covid,"" and the companies now must set their sights on converting pirates into subscribers, gaining greater market share from each other and driving up prices.""

Increasing prices won't help Netflix in the short term, though it raised its fees in January to the extent that it is now the most expensive among the major streamers.

""I think they'll have to adjust their business,"" said Paul Hardart, a professor at New York University, including ""on the cost side, investing in content.""

For University of Richmond professor Joel Mier, Netflix's price increases and axing of password sharing are ""peripheral but meaningful"" short-term solutions, while its long-term strategy remains ""investing in local-content creation and establishing its gaming presence.""

With 221 million subscribers, ""Netflix is by far the market leader in the streaming space,"" Zari said.

""They're very far ahead, particularly in the global marketplace,"" said Hardart. ""I think it will give them a lot of advantages.""

The problems Netflix faces are ""not good news"" for the company, he emphasized.

But as the global leader, whatever Netflix goes through, the other streamers are also likely to face eventually.

It's ""probably worse news for the other services that are starting to try to build themselves,"" he said.

176,News,"Family members and relatives of passengers on board the Twin Otter aircraft operated by Tara Air weep outside the airport in Pokhara on May 29, 2022 after the plane with 22 people on board went missing.


By 
AFP




A passenger plane with 22 people on board went missing in Nepal on Sunday, the operating airline and officials said, as poor weather hampered a search operation.

Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has a poor safety record.

The Twin Otter aircraft operated by Tara Air took off from the western town of Pokhara bound for Jomsom at 9.55am (0410 GMT) but air traffic control lost contact after 15 minutes.

""We are trying to locate the possible area where the aircraft might be,"" Sudarshan Bartaula, spokesman for Tara Air, told AFP.

""Search and rescue teams from both the police and the army are heading towards that direction.""

He said there were 19 passengers on board and three crew members. The passengers included two Germans and four Indians, with the remainder Nepali.

Jomsom is a popular trekking destination in the Himalayas about 20 minutes by plane from Pokhara, which lies 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu.

Phanindra Mani Pokharel, a spokesman at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said two helicopters had been deployed for a search operation.

But he said visibility was low. 

""The bad weather is likely to hamper the search operation. The visibility is so poor that nothing can be seen,"" Pokharel said.

Nepal's aviation industry has long been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance.

The European Union has banned all Nepali airlines from its airspace over safety concerns.

The Himalayan country also has some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge for even accomplished pilots.

The weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.

In March 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines plane crashed near Kathmandu's notoriously difficult-to-approach international airport, killing 51 people. 

The flight from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka crash-landed and skidded into a football field where it burst into flames. 

Twenty passengers miraculously escaped the burning wreckage but sustained serious injuries.

An investigation found that the captain suffered an emotional breakdown during the flight, distracting the freshly qualified co-pilot who was at the controls when it crashed.

The report said air traffic control also confused the two ends of the runway, but concluded this had no impact on the flight.

The accident was Nepal's deadliest since 1992 when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.

Just two months earlier a Thai Airways aircraft crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.

In 2019 three people died when a plane veered off the runway and hit two helicopters while taking off near Mount Everest.

The accident happened at Lukla airport which is the main gateway to the Everest region and is reputed to be one of the most difficult in the world for landing and take-off.

Also in 2019 Nepal's tourism minister Rabindra Adhikari was among seven people killed when a helicopter crashed in the country's hilly east.

This month Nepal's second international airport opened at Bhairahawa, aiming to give Buddhist pilgrims from across Asia access to the Buddha's birthplace at nearby Lumbini.

The USD76 million project will ease pressure on the overburdened Kathmandu international airport.

There were 19 passengers and three crew members on board the Twin Otter aircraft, operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air, airline spokesman Sudarshan Bartaula told AFP. The passengers included two Germans and four Indians, with the remainder Nepali.

Before the wreckage was found, Pokhara Airport spokesman Dev Raj Subedi told AFP early Monday morning that rescue helicopters and army troops on the ground had shifted their search to a suspected crash site. 

""The search operation has resumed... There has not been any significant improvement in the weather. Two helicopters have flown toward the area but they have not been able to land yet,"" he said. 

Subedi said that they had followed GPS, mobile and satellite signals to the location. 

The flight took off from the western town of Pokhara for Jomsom on Sunday at 9:55 am (0410 GMT), but air traffic control lost contact after 15 minutes, the airline said.

Jomsom is a popular trekking destination in the Himalayas about 20 minutes by plane from Pokhara, which lies 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. 

Flight operator Tara Air is a subsidiary of Yeti Airlines, a privately owned domestic carrier that services many remote destinations across Nepal. 

It suffered its last fatal accident in 2016 on the same route when a plane with 23 on board crashed into a mountainside in Myagdi district. 

Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has long been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance. 

The European Union has banned all Nepali airlines from its airspace over safety concerns. 

The Himalayan country also has some of the world's most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots. 

The weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.

Welcome!"
174,News,"Former Central Bank of Kenya Governor Duncan Ndegwa displaying one of his four books he launched at the Continental Resort in Mombasa on December 17, 2021.


Prime



By 
Godwin Siundu




A new book by Duncan Ndegwa, Moi’s Kleptocracy and Its Spillovers, makes interesting claims regarding the role that former president Daniel Arap Moi played in retarding Kenya’s economic development and impeding national unity by playing divisive ethnic politics, among other failures. 

I find the book useful for three main reasons. One, that it is authored by a key player in the civil service of both Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel Moi presidencies, a position that no doubt allowed him a wider scope in perceiving the routine developments in the then young nation and which, therefore, predispose him towards a better understanding of the inner workings of government at a time when Kenya could have, but did not take the leap of economic growth and nation building that have been the desire of many Kenyans through the years. 

Second, Ndegwa’s new book is timely given that few others of his standing in government, especially those who served in the 60s through to the 80s, such as Charles Njonjo, have cared to voice their views regarding what exactly went wrong in the early years of independence, replacing the excitements of political freedom with the despair of dictatorship and primitive materialism. 

Third, and perhaps the most important contribution of the book, is that while the economic failures and draconian style of the Moi regime have largely been attributed to his intellectual frailties and personal cowardice, especially after the attempted coup of 1982, Ndegwa argues strongly that Moi’s failure was a deliberate and cynical scheme by a cold and calculating leader determined to undo the gains of his more charismatic and intellectually respected predecessor. 

Generally, Ndegwa’s take on Moi’s kleptocracy and its ramifications in contemporary Kenya is a worthwhile read, although one must be prepared to accommodate a fawning portrayal of Jomo Kenyatta and a resolute determination to overlook any redeeming attribute in Moi. 

The book has 11 substantive chapters, which collectively locate Kenya’s economic and political misfortunes in colonial and post-independence histories. Acknowledging that some of the colonialist initiatives could well have been useful, Ndegwa nonetheless argues that the colonial ideology of zoning the country along the logics of economic potential, the white highlands versus the native reserves, for instance, as well as assigning stereotypical attributes to the dominant ethnic communities spatially distributed in these zones, certainly proved politically useful to insecure post-independence leaders, the worst of them being Moi. 

For instance, the politically engineered violence by the later colonial regimes left many people without land, limbs and lives. This had spillovers that later became useful to President Daniel Moi as he sought to entrench himself as a cultic, kleptomaniac ruler whose earlier obsession with Majimbo politics was a smokescreen for incorrigible tribalism. 

Positioning himself as Jomo’s more malleable vice president compared to the cantankerous Jaramogi or introverted Murumbi, Moi waited out as Jomo put in place infrastructural and production developments under the auspices of various parastatal bodies, including the ICDC, the Kenya Tea Development Authority, the coffee Board of Kenya, and the Kenya Industrial Estates. When his time came, Moi would systemically run down these and other institutions, placing them on the watch of his buddies who hollowed them out. 

Yet, they were never eventually punished, partly because they enjoyed Moi’s uncritical patronage, and partly because of a tame Judiciary that had ceded virtually all its ground to the tentacles of Moi’s executive and repressive apparatus.

The front page cover of the book Moi’s Kleptocracy and Its Spillovers authored by former Central Bank of Kenya Governor Duncan Ndegwa.

Collectively, in Ndegwa’s view, Moi was determined to ensure that the bulk of his subjects were an impoverished lot that was more susceptible to his occasional handouts either in cash or token appointments to public positions. 

Whether Ndegwa’s interpretation of Moi’s version of scorched earthed destruction of the economic lives of Kenyans is overly cynical or actually objective is a different question altogether. What is critical, I think, is that it explains why even local initiatives such as the cooperative movements in coffee, milk, maize, tobacco, sugar, and other people-driven attempts at economic empowerment went under as soon as the Moi government showed interest in them. 

The initiatives were deliberately undermined, plundered and left mere shells. Kisumu Cotton Millers, Kenya Cooperative Creameries, Kenya Meat Commission, and others went this route, while many others in the sugar sector were barely functional by the time Moi left. 

In all, Moi oversaw a dangerous culture of client-patron politics that empowered a few cronies at the cost of the dignified lives of most Kenyans, facilitating theft of public funds to be spirited to foreign banks, abdication of duty, and near-collapse in service delivery.

Given Moi’s penchant for obsequious behaviour from his underlings, a battalion of senior civil servants and politicians was a common sight wherever he went – and he was almost always on the road. They all drew huge allowances without working, thereby depleting the little that ordinary mortals had contributed to the economy. 

Ndegwa ultimately argues that Moi and his inner circle of a political and civil service class deliberately set Kenyans up for economic disaster. Even when they mouthed economic policies and initiatives, they were careful to ensure that these initiatives failed because their core purpose was to provide opportunities for a few well connected Kenyans to draw huge financial returns for private gain.

Two examples suffice. One was the pomp associated with the Nyayo Bus Corporation that was launched in 1986 after gobbling huge amounts of public funds. The buses were cannibalized and cheaply resold, but not before a few individuals pocketed the fare paid by the public. 

The second was so cynical that it warrants to hear Ndegwa speak for himself. “Some of the Nyayo projects were not only major drains in financial terms but also ecological and health disasters. Nyayo Tea Zones and research by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) on Kemron, a phony HIV/Aids cure are good examples.” Further, “hospitals around the country were forced to buy and store huge stocks of Kemron yet finances never reached the Treasury. Thousands of Kenyans may have died as a result of taking a non-effective drug peddled as the cure for AIDS.” 

In all, Ndegwa is of the view that Kenya as a national entity was collapsing under Moi’s deliberate mismanagement where corruption and theft became so rampant that, given our adjacency to war torn neighbours, we soon provided havens for terrorists, drug and human traffickers, money launderers, and all sorts of folks who would be unwelcome anywhere else. In short, Kenya was under siege, all because of Moi’s kleptomania, tribalism, and a deep-seated hatred for all the things that Kenyatta had achieved before him. 

It will take years, if at all, to undo the damage that Moi inflicted on Kenyans during his reign. This calls for a deliberate “crafting a soul for Kenya” by building on inclusive politics, appreciation of opportunities in resources across the country, such as the Lake Victoria Basin, the Lake Turkana Plateau, the North Eastern Region, the Coast, and the Tana and Athi River belt. All these regions can be progressively brought into mainstream economic life of Kenya, for the good of every Kenyan.

173,News,"Elkana Ongesa’s Bird of Peace watches over the Murumbi graves. 


By 
John Fox




The graves have been raided; land grabbers have encroached; and sculptures have been vandalised

Alan Donovan opened his lovingly illustrated memoir, ‘My Journey Through Africa’ with a quotation from the film version of ‘Out of Africa’. It has Denys Finch Hatton saying to Karen Blixen, ‘We are not owners here, Karen, we’re just passing through.’

Sadly, Alan Donovan, after living in Africa for five decades, has himself passed through. At the age of 81, after doing more than perhaps anyone to raise our awareness of the richness of African art, Alan died early last month.

From his native America – born on a farm in Colorado – he first came to Africa in 1967, the same year I did. He came as a food relief officer in Biafra, the attempted breakaway region in the east of Nigeria. There, he witnessed the bitterness and cruelty of war. After two years he resigned his post, bought a Volkswagen mini-bus in Paris, and travelled through the Sahara Desert to Nigeria, and then across to the Congo and, finally, to Kenya – arriving in Nairobi in March 1970. As he says in his book, since then he ‘served as a conduit and catalyst to reveal the awesome beauty of Africa’.

He founded African Heritage in Nairobi – the continent’s first pan-African Gallery. His co-founder was Joseph Murumbi, Kenya’s second Vice-President and collector of African art. I had the privilege to interview Murumbi not long before he died. In his wheelchair, he showed me the magnificent collection of art works he had in his house. I asked him why he had resigned as Vice President in 1966 after only 10 months in office. His words said much more than their literal meaning: ‘Everything you have seen in this house I have bought with money I have earned.’

I have been fortunate, also, to talk many times with Alan Donovan. Once, we were sitting in the garden of his amazing African Heritage House, with a design inspired by the mud architectures Alan had seen in his travels across Africa. Overlooking the Nairobi National Park, it became, as he said, ‘the most photographed house in Africa.’

I met him at the Kampala Serena, when he was working on replicas of ancient terracotta sculptures that were to be displayed in the hotel’s public rooms. There was the time when he was setting up an exhibition of Murumbi’s vast stamp collection in the National Archives in Moi Avenue.

A few times we have talked at the Nairobi Gallery at the corner of Kenyatta Avenue and Uhuru Highway. It is there that Alan Donovan made sure there would be a fitting home for the Murumbi African Heritage Collections.

 For Alan, Murumbi was a close friend as well as a business partner. Since Murumbi’s death in 1990, Alan devoted much of his time to ensuring that his friend would be honoured for what he did as a patriot, a pan-Africanist and a collector of African art. And he wanted to, if not erase, but at least soften the memory that Murumbi had been betrayed by the government that had promised to support the creation of a Pan-African Studies Centre at his house in Muthaiga that he had sold to them.

It was not an easy task. Alan endured many bureaucratic delays and rebuffs. Even securing a resting place for Joseph and Sheila Murumbi in the City Park has had some grim challenges. The graves have been raided; land grabbers have encroached; sculptures have been vandalised.

Last Sunday, I went to see how the Murumbi Peace Memorial Garden is now. I was disappointed. Weeds are growing around the paving stones; the information boards are faded and peeling. The place is not well tended. The whole City Park is in a scruffy state.

It is good that the African Heritage House has been made a National Monument. But it now needs a guardian who will carry on Alan Donovan’s work, so that the place will continue to live up to its name.

By

Reporter

Members of Parliament now want a clause in the Sh364 billion standard gauge railway (SGR) loan contract with China that attaches the port of Mombasa as collateral to be reviewed. 

The National Assembly’s Public Investments Committee (PIC), in a report tabled before the House, says the loan agreement was skewed against the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and should be renegotiated.

The committee chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswamad Nassir says the loan repayment agreement lists KPA and the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) as borrowers and, therefore, liable to repay the loan owed to China Exim Bank in case of default.

Also Read: Mombasa Port: How auditor-general misread China’s SGR contracts

Kenya waived its immunity in the matter, meaning the country would surrender KPA assets, the main one being the port of Mombasa if it fails to repay.

“A reading of the agreement left no doubt that KPA and KRC were borrowers and liable to repay the loan through their assets without immunity. This put the assets of KPA at risk in the event of a default,” reads the report.

“The committee recommends that the National Treasury should renegotiate the entire payment arrangement agreement with a view to discharging KPA from the contract and replacing it with KRC,” the report says. KPA in its response said it does not have capacity to hold sovereign authority and therefore could not plead sovereign immunity.

“Only the Government of Kenya had such capacity. The clause could not be enforced against KPA. This was a mistake apparent on the face of the record,” KPA said. It added that it had no copies of the preferential credit loan agreement since it was not a party to the agreements.

More shocking is that the committee noted that the placement of KPA in the repayment of the loan was done without the approval of the board, parent ministry and the Cabinet. According to the report, the repayment of the loan agreement in clause 17.5 referred to KPA as the borrower, contrary to the details that KPA’s only obligation was to facilitate minimum freight volumes to meet the requirements of the long-term service agreement.

“It was inconceivable that KPA could sign an agreement with KRC agreeing to provide a certain tonnage of goods for transport through the SGR and be held liable in the event of failure in a free-market economy where transporters were at liberty to use any mode of transport including road,” reads the report. In the event of failure by KRC to pay China Exim Bank collected freight and service charges, KPA would be compelled to deposit the amount due to KRC into a bank account designated by the bank.

Both KPA and KRC indicated to the committee that the required tonnage had not been met, thus forcing KPA to pay China Exim Bank through KRC.

The report, however, does not disclose the amount that has so far been paid by KPA to China. According to the report, the loan amount consisted of a preferential credit loan agreement of May 11, 2014 for Sh161.6 billion and a buyer credit loan agreement of the same date for Sh202.36 billion, all totalling Sh363.96 billion from China Exim bank.

The committee, however, noted that the two loans had separate agreements which were not produced for audit review. In a shocking revelation contained in the report, both the KPA and KRC management claimed to have no access to such documents.

The two loan agreements were also not provided to Parliament and the committee’s written requests to both Attorney-General Paul Kihara and the National Treasury for submission of the documents remained unanswered until the time the report was tabled in the House.

The committee recommended that the Head of the Public Service should submit the two SGR loan agreements to the Office of the Auditor-General for verification during the 2022/2023 audit cycle. The committee has also faulted the terms of the agreement, which, it points out, are unfavourable to KRC, the government and KPA since all disputes were to be referred to China.

According to the agreement at Paragraph 17.2, in case of any dispute, it shall be referred by any party to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Cietac) for arbitration in accordance with Cietac’s applicable rules. The place of arbitration shall be Beijing.

The report is scheduled to be considered by the House next week.

171,News,"The habit of watching adult movies hardly starts when partners start a relationship.


By 
Simon Mburu




Not many people in relationships will admit to watching adult movies or incorporating adult movies into their sex lives. However, websites that host adult content are very popular. Alexa, a global website traffic ranking site ranks porn sites among the most frequently visited sites globally. In Kenya, these websites have previously featured among the top ten most popular websites. According to counseling psychologist Raphael Mundia, adult content is consumed behind closed doors because it is frowned upon by society. “Consumption of pornography is accompanied by feelings of guilt and shame because of its close association with immorality,” she says. “People who consume this content are considered immoral or psychologically disturbed.” Indeed, there are aspects of adult content that out rightly promote immorality and illegalities. In December 2020, the world’s most popular adult content platform was forced to delete millions of adult materials and institute new user restrictions after a report exposed how sex trafficking victims were being exploited on its platform.

Perceptions

Pornography in relationships is bound to elicit two opposing perceptions. On one hand, there is the perception that pornography helps to spice up a couple’s sex life.  On the other hand, adult movies are seen as a form of cheating and pointer to sexual dissatisfaction. “One of the most common comments I get from women whose men watch porn is: ‘I feel like when we have sex, he’s not really doing it with me but with the imaginary female porn models he watches’,” says family therapist Grace Kariuki. The habit of watching adult movies hardly starts when partners start a relationship. “Almost all of my infidelity cases have a background of porn consumption, starting off as early as during adolescence, nurtured masturbation, then sex with multiple partners, and later during a relationship or marriage, deteriorated into cheating or adultery,” says Ms. Kariuki. This is echoed by Ari Tuckman, the author of More Attention, Less Deficit, who says that the ripple effect is that the usage of pornography tends to lead the user into solo sexual activities such as masturbation.

Genesis of problems

Unlike the popular belief that the consumption of adult movies is the onset of problems in relationships, usage of porn tends to be a result of other problems that a couple may be facing. “There are men who feel diminishing love or attraction for their partners, and they often turn to pornography for solace, excitement, arousal, and soothing. In such instances, pornography isn’t to blame for their relationship struggles,” says David Ley, the author of Women Who Stray and The Men Who Love Them.

The impact

Pornography in a relationship impacts the man and the woman differently. According to Dr. Wendy Patrick, a behavioural analyst and the author of Red Flags, women who experience a higher level of anxious attachment will have lower levels of satisfaction in the relationship when they use pornography with their partner. However, men who generally view pornography positively will have greater relationship satisfaction in spite of their anxieties. “The downside is that men who turn to pornography as a means of coping with stress and bad emotions have lower levels of sexual arousal and lower sexual intercourse with their spouses,” she says. There are also instances where untamed porn can mess up your sex drive. “There is a possibility that your sex life has suffered because of porn if you are always wanting kinkier sex, often feeling dissatisfied and restless, find your partner less attractive or need more of extreme adult content,” says Dr. Chris Hart, a psychologist based in Nairobi. This gets compounded when one partner becomes preoccupied with porn to a point of ignoring their spousal, family, and career responsibilities.

The other side of the coin

According to Dr. Jessica O’Reilly, a sexologist and the author of The Ultimate Guide to Seduction and Foreplay, the effects of pornography on relationships are not as dire as they are often made out to be. “There is this myth that porn is a public health hazard. The reality is that the effects of porn are not as detrimental as we’d like to believe,” she says. Where pornography is an issue in the relationship, there will tend to be another bigger issue hiding beneath the surface. “People say they are addicted to porn, but the actual fact is that porn is usually a symptom of the problem.” “If mutually agreed upon and if partners have the capacity to distinguish the right kind of sexual engagement from the abusive and demeaning, it could be irregularly used as a catalyst to more exciting physical intimacy,” says Raphael. He cautions that you must never base your sexual expectations on porn. “Porn can be highly addictive based on how you approach and consume it. It is also unreal because it involves premeditated and induced acts, while intimacy brings together a combination of affection, genuine desire, love, and playfulness.”

Porn as a measure of compatibility

Openly discussing with your partner whether or not you should include porn in your relationship could spur an improvement in your sex life regardless of the outcome. “It shouldn’t necessarily be about the players, but about broader issues such as your turn-ons, fantasies, sexuality, desires, and intimacy,” says Tuckman. That said, your problems with pornography as a couple will begin the moment you start using adult content as a guide to sex. “There will be a problem if watching pornography becomes a substitute for sex or stimulation by your own partner,” she says. “Use it in moderation and be honest with your partner about it. If you don’t agree on porn, then you’re probably not compatible.”


If you start taking more risks to get your fix, this may mean you are struggling with a gambling addiction.


Caffeinated drinks such as coffee can be replaced with decaffeinated beverages, herbal teas, or hot chocolate.

Morocco's national regulatory agency overseeing the use of cannabis for medical use met for the first time Thursday in one of the last steps before legalisation in the world's top cannabis-resin producer.

The North African nation adopted a law in 2021 provisionally authorising the legal uses of cannabis for medical, cosmetic and industrial uses, and tasked a national agency to oversee the process.

Chaired by Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit, the ""National Agency for the Regulation of Cannabis Activities"" approved its organisation chart and budget for the year 2022.

Also Read: Nairobi’s ‘ganja babies’ - In Kenya, a puff a day keeps the doctor away

The agency will be responsible for controlling all stages of the production chain, from the import of seeds to the marketing of cannabis products.

It will also include overseeing licensing procedures for national and international operators in the legal cannabis industry.

The agency will also establish cooperatives of local farmers.

Cannabis output in the North African country was estimated to total more than 700 tonnes in a 2020 study by the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime.

According to a 2020 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Morocco is the world's biggest producer of cannabis resin, or hashish.

It was banned in Morocco in 1954 but has been tolerated as its cultivation provides a livelihood for at least 60,000 families, farming across some 55,000 hectares (136,000 acres).

Also Read: Is it time to legalise medical marijuana?

Farming is concentrated in the impoverished northern Rif mountains.

Now the kingdom hopes that cultivating cannabis for medical use will become a lucrative business and place Morocco on the global market.

According to Morocco's interior ministry, the market worldwide is growing at an annual rate of 30 percent, and by 60 percent a year in Europe.

Only six technical decrees remain to be adopted before the full legalisation of the plant.

Recreational use of cannabis, however, will remain prohibited.

169,News," An officer walks outside of Robb Elementary School.


By 
AFP




The day after his 18th birthday, Salvador Ramos, a troubled teenager from small-town Texas, bought an assault rifle.

A week later, he walked into a local elementary school, where he shot and killed 19 young children and two of their teachers.

Under fire over a police delay in confronting the shooter, authorities on Friday released the most complete timeline yet of how the attack unfolded:

Ramos crashes a vehicle near Robb Elementary. He took the truck from the house where he lived with his grandmother, who he shot in the face before driving to the school.

He emerges from the wrecked truck with an assault rifle and fires on two bystanders at a nearby funeral home. He also repeatedly shoots at the school.

Ramos enters the school through a door that was apparently unlocked. He goes into a classroom and unleashes a barrage of bullets, firing at least 100 rounds.

Three Uvalde police officers enter the school. Two of them are wounded by bullets apparently fired by Ramos through a closed door.

The officers are later followed by three more from the same department, and a county deputy sheriff.

As many as 19 police officers are gathered in the hallway outside the classroom in which Ramos has barricaded himself.

At 12:03, police receive a 911 call from a child, giving her name and whispering that she is inside room 112 of the school. 

Read: Gunman kills 19 children at Texas primary school

After that she calls back multiple times.

At 12:10, she tells responders there are multiple dead. At 12:13 she calls again.

Again at 12:16, the student calls to say there are eight or nine students still alive.

At 12:21, three shots are heard over a 911 call made by another person. 

Read: The victims of the tragic US school shooting

At 12:36, the initial child calls back and is told to stay on the line. She tells 911 that the gunman has shot the door,

At approximately 12:43 and 12:47, she asks 911 to ""please send the police now.""

The first members of a Border Patrol tactical team arrive on site.

The tactical team opens the classroom using keys obtained from a janitor, enters the room, and kills Ramos.

The child's final call is cut off after she made it outside the classroom.

168,News,"Brazil's Gabriel Barbosa (R) celebrates with teammate Neymar after scoring against Venezuela during their Conmebol Copa America 2021 tournament. Neymar's salary is almost exactly the same as 1693 female players.  



The glass ceiling is a subtle but damaging form of discrimination where you cannot take the opportunities you see in front of you, despite your suitability. The glass ceiling still exists across various industries for different groups of people. Men still occupy most of the executive positions in corporations and other positions of power.

Although there is more attention given to these barriers, they are still present in the workplace. We have a gender pay gap. Despite that, even with a higher education level, women earn less than men. Although the difference between men’s and women’s earnings has declined in recent years, in 2016 women still received the equivalent of 76.5 per cent of men’s earnings.

This happens in politics, sports, business, and medicine and space exploration. Gender inequality in football is worse than in politics, according to a survey that compared the employment status and pay of thousands of male and female footballers worldwide.

Among a number of stark findings was that the combined pay of those playing in the top seven women’s football league equals that of a single male footballer, the Brazilian forward Neymar, who plays for the French club Paris St Germaine. His salary is almost exactly the same as 1693 female players in France, Germany, England, US, Sweden, Australia and Mexico combined according to the Sporting Intelligence annual salary survey.

The gender pay gap is often explained away by those who argue that men’s sport is much more commercially successful than women’s sport. The gender disparity applies to employment status, too. In England, the FA which banned women’s football for five decades until 1971, only relatively recently introduced a professional league.

While there are 137,021 male professionals in the world, there are only 1,287 female players. This represents just 0.93 per cent and compares unfavourably with even the most traditionally male-dominated industries. Is there space for more women at the top?

What’s more, the study found that staying in the bed too long was likely to make your brain smaller too.

167,News,"TVET remains one of the much sung-about sub-sector in education—if the oft-repeated policy statements and regular exhortation of the great strides that Kenya is making towards innovation and job creation courtesy of TVET is anything to go by.

The Ministry of Education, under Cabinet Secretary George Magoha, has made laudable progress in all sub-sectors of education.

Its achievements include enhanced education access at all levels, successful milestone reforms to roll out Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) and heightened vigilance against cheating in examinations.

However, there is one critical area the ministry has grossly mishandled or neglected: The welfare of about 20,000 trainers in TVET institutions. The trainers include those deployed by the Public Service Commission (PSC), who are the minority, and those hired directly by the institutions.

The latter are the ones who run the centres. Without these trainers, learning would come to a halt. For every PSC trainer, there are four to five contract trainers.

TVET remains one of the much sung-about sub-sector in education—if the oft-repeated policy statements and regular exhortation of the great strides that Kenya is making towards innovation and job creation courtesy of TVET is anything to go by.

However, those official epithets tend to overshadow the pathetic working conditions and dismal remuneration of the trainers. Unless the matter is addressed soon, quality of training and, by extension, that of the TVET graduates stands to suffer terribly.

A little background is in order.

In 2018, the government changed the employer for all teachers deployed by TSC in technical institutions by transferring them to PSC. This affected some 3,800 teachers in polytechnics, technical institutes and TVETs.

That number, ministry officials said, was a far cry from the optimal 11,000 for 120,000 students at the time. The government pledged regular recruitment, which has seen an additional 3,000 trainers recruited by the PSC in three cycles since 2018.

The less than 8,000 PSC trainers are still too few for the three categories of TVETs, which have grown by 400 per cent; official figures put the enrollment at 450,000 students. The number of centres has also increased multifold to about 240 nationally.

But it is the recruitment and welfare of that cadre of trainers, numbering over 15,000, that is a matter of serious concern.

The trainers should not only be acquainted with CBC but also motivated enough to help in realising its objectives at that level. Secondly, the trainers, whom many institutions hire on word of mouth and fire them the same way, earn a paltry Sh12,000-30,000 without fringe benefits.

Save for a few, most of the TVETs conduct shambolic recruitment amid cronyism, tribalism and outright corruption. The PSC recruitment in 2019 was reportedly marred by irregularities that occasioned a probe by Parliament’s Committee on Education, prompting the parent ministry to demand a report from the heads of institutions where glaring irregularities were noted.

166,News,"In Kenya, over 40 per cent of women are likely to face SGBV during their lifetime.



A friend was recently attacked by a maniac she was dating. I thought it was the occasional case of gender-based violence in Kenya or around the world until someone recounted the case to me.

The woman was hanging out with a male friend in a big town when the partner showed up, slapped the friend, forced the woman into a waiting car and they went to a living complex where he proceeded to assault her physically and sexually. He dared her to try and travel back to school where she was due to present her final-year project.

That was the short version of the story. The incident started with a phone call by someone who had the sole purpose of keeping tabs on who this woman was hanging out with. A few minutes later, someone was assaulted in public and there was a commotion that attracted onlookers, then someone was forced to board a vehicle in broad daylight.

The events culminated in the woman being battered in her own unit that had neighbours; she screamed, hoping someone would help, but no one did. After the man was done with his evil acts, he simply walked out of the house, went on to have a good time with his family, leaving the victim to nurse her wounds.

She had to call her mother, who was a few hours away, to get help. Even then, they had to pay the police to make the arrest. No one came to the aid of the young man who was slapped. No one tried stopping a man from forcing a woman into a car. The driver didn’t object to driving. No reasonable neighbour tried to help; no one called the police, and if someone did, they didn’t show up.

Is the violence in Kenya culturally reinforced to the point where the family of the man thought that a few cows would be enough to make the incident okay? They offered cows to wish the whole incident away. Cows in exchange for a human being’s dignity! Sounds like a reasonable trade-off in our twisted society—an admission of guilt by perpetrators of violence who, somehow, think going to jail for rape and assault is a step too far. No, it’s not!

A quick introspection into the scourge of violence would reveal that we need to re-examine our cultural values. Parents raise children by beating them, teachers teach with an iron rod, lovers embrace with clenched fists, the electorate engage each other with weapons, police work is shooting at unarmed people, and the best punishment for a criminal in Kenya is lynching. Cabinet discussions sometimes centre around reintroducing caning in schools.

We should discourage violence as a tool for motivation or deterrence and maybe engage our most valuable tools, our brains, in the form of reason, in decision-making. It will serve us better if we use logical reasoning instead of instilling fear in our complex human relationships.

165,News,"Argentina's striker Lionel Messi is thrown into the air by his teammates as they celebrate their win on the pitch after the 'Finalissima' International friendly match against Italy at Wembley Stadium in London on June 1, 2022. 


By 
AFP




Lionel Messi stole the show as Copa America holders Argentina powered to a 3-0 win against European champions Italy in the Finalissima at Wembley on Wednesday.

Inspired by the peerless Messi, Argentina raced into a two-goal lead in the first half of the prestigious friendly thanks to strikes from Lautaro Martinez and Angel Di Maria.

Paulo Dybala capped Argentina's rout, but after a disappointing season with Paris Saint-Germain by his sky-high standards, it was the sight of Messi back to his imperious best that took the spotlight.

The 34-year-old's eye-catching display featured two assists and was worthy of his rare appearance at one of football's great cathedrals.

It was another memorable moment for Argentina, who have qualified for this year's World Cup as they extend the golden afterglow from the victory over Brazil that ended their 28-year wait to win the Copa America in 2021.

Argentina were already established as one of the leading contenders to win the World Cup and defeating Italy was another statement of intent from La Albiceleste, who are now unbeaten in 32 matches.

If Messi can play at this level in Qatar, Lionel Scaloni's side will be a force to be reckoned with as they chase a first World Cup title since 1986.

For Italy, it was a disappointing return to Wembley 11 months after they beat England on penalties in the Euro 2020 final.

Roberto Mancini's team have gone into a steep decline since that memorable triumph.

They failed to qualify for the World Cup after suffering a humiliating loss to North Macedonia in their play-off semi-final.

Mancini admitted the Finalissima represented the ""end of a cycle"" for his European champions.

After the World Cup failure, Mancini is transitioning to a younger generation, with the forthcoming Nations League matches against Germany, England and Hungary his real focus.

Mancini's overhaul effectively started at half-time when Italy said farewell to 117-cap skipper Giorgio Chiellini, who was substituted in his final game before international retirement.

- Messi masterpiece -

This was only the third Finalissima contest between the respective champions of Europe and South America and the first since Diego Maradona's Argentina beat Denmark in 1993.

Fittingly, Messi -- the heir to the legendary Maradona -- used the occasion to remind the world of his astonishing talents.

The 80,000 sell-out crowd created a colourful backdrop for Messi's mastery, with Argentina's raucous fans turning the north London suburb of Brent into Buenos Aires for one ear-splitting evening.

Every touch from Messi lifted the decibel levels and moments after his shot was saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma, the forward played a key role as Argentina took the lead in the 28th minute.

Messi worked his magic on the touchline, showing tremendous strength to hold off Giovanni Di Lorenzo before unfurling a precise low cross to Martinez, who applied the finishing touch from close-range.

Italy argued that the goal should have been disallowed for a foul in the build-up, but their protests were in vain.

With tempers still running high, Leonardo Bonucci was booked after leaving Messi writhing in pain with a flailing arm that caught him in the face.

Di Maria exacted revenge on Messi's behalf in first half stoppage-time.

Martinez drove forward with bullish tenacity and slipped a perfectly weighted pass to Di Maria, with the PSG forward producing a finish to match the approach play as he clipped a cool finish over Donnarumma.

Di Maria almost struck again on the hour, but his curler was brilliantly tipped over by Donnarumma as it fizzed towards the far corner.

Messi robbed Jorginho and embarked on a mesmerising run that finished with a save from Donnarumma.

Messi's name echoed around the stands as Argentina's fans paid tribute to their idol's latest masterpiece.

Dybala's clinical strike in stoppage-time came via a deft Messi pass as the maestro provided one final flourish.

164,News,"Understanding changes that happen during menopause makes it easy to cope with symptoms.


By 
Fiona Muthoni








If you are in your 40s or 50s, you may be experiencing menopause. This time in a woman's life is marked by changes in the body, including fluctuations in hormones and hot flashes. While some women sail through menopause with hardly any symptoms, others find it challenging.

This article will discuss the body changes that occur during menopause and what you can do to manage them.

Few women sail through menopause without experiencing any emotional changes. For some, menopause brings feelings of sadness and loneliness. Others may feel angry and irritable.

These emotional changes can be attributed to hormonal fluctuations during menopause. Some women may also find it challenging to cope with the physical changes that menopause brings such as hot flashes and weight gain.

Night sweats can also cause sleep deprivation, further contributing to emotional instability.

Counselling and support groups can provide a forum for sharing experiences and coping strategies.

Exercise and relaxation techniques can also help to alleviate stress and improve mood.

Many women find that they have difficulty sleeping during menopause. This can be due to hot flashes, night sweats, anxiety, and stress.

If you are having trouble sleeping, there are some things you can do to improve the situation.

First, establish a regular sleep schedule and stick to it as much as possible. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed and create a relaxing bedtime routine.

If hot flashes keep you up at night, try taking a cool shower before bed or sleeping with a fan in your room.

Some medications such as melatonin supplements or prescription sleep aids can help with insomnia. Consult the doctor for such prescriptions.

Hot flashes are one of the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting a huge percentage of women.

A hot flash is a sudden feeling of warmth, often accompanied by a red, flushed face and sweating.

Hot flashes are experienced mostly at night but can also occur during the day.

They can last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Some women experience them multiple times a day.

There are several things you can do to manage hot flashes.

Weight gain is a common symptom of menopause, and it can be attributed to a number of factors.

Hormonal changes during menopause can lead to an increase in body fat.

In addition, many women find that their metabolism slows down as they age, making it harder to maintain a healthy weight.

Some experience accumulation of fat around the abdomen, while others may see a general increase in overall body size.

You can do a few things to combat weight gain during menopause.

Many women experience a decrease in libido during menopause. This can be due to the hormonal changes that occur during this time and the physical changes (such as weight gain and vaginal dryness) and emotional changes (such as stress and anxiety).

There are a few things you can do to increase your libido.

As hormone levels fluctuate, many women experience longer or shorter cycle lengths, lighter or heavier bleeding, or skipped periods altogether. This is one of the first signs of menopause.

In addition, fertility decreases due to the lower number of eggs being produced.

If you are trying to conceive, it is important to talk to your doctor about your options.


In girls, puberty occurs between 8 and 13 years, but it may occur earlier or later. Every child is different, and changes can affect them differently. 


Cancer treatment and care costs go at between Sh. 758,000 and Sh. 2.48 million per case if a partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, lumpectomy, or quadrantectomy surgical procedure is...

163,News,"Men get abused , too. We need to talk about it. Photo | Photosearch


By 
Abigail Arunga


Writer

Abuse is not a one-way street. Let us not let our personal bias make us ignore the fact that this is happening to men, too, as surprising as it may sound.





Have you been watching the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case? If so, then you know that this is a trigger warning for violence, abuse, and downright weird goings-on.

For those who are not aware, Johnny Depp is the actor behind some of Hollywood’s creepiest, ghouliest, delightfully silly roles, such as Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd in the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and unforgettably, Jack Sparrow in all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies ever made. Amber Heard, also a Hollywood darling until recent events came to light, was the leading lady in Jason Momoa’s – sorry, DC’s - Aquaman, and was all set to star once again in the next installment.



The couple first met on the set of the film ""The Rum Diary"" in 2009, began dating, and later got engaged in 2014. In 2016, Heard filed for divorce after 15 months of marriage and cited abuse. 

And so Depp retaliated and countersued, for defamation. Apparently, he has lost a lot of work because of her accusations, which he says don’t tell the full story. And boy, is the full story gruesome. There’re testimonies from her PA, their therapist, former workers – all pretty incriminating stuff, such as her saying that she didn’t ‘punch him, she only hit him,’ allegations that she cut his finger off, and more recently, that she took a dump in their bed. On Depp’s end, there are some heavily murderous text messages, about how he wants to kill Heard, and what he’ll do to her body when she’s dead.

It's a bit of a strange case to deal with when you think about it. When Amber Heard came out with her story, we all sided with her. Of course! We believe victims here. And though we (ok, I) have loved Johnny Depp since 21 Jump Street, anyone can catch these cancel culture hands. I don’t condone violence and when I can, or if I have the power of discernment to, I will do my best not to support it. But then when the truth began to leak out, it got awkward. It makes things a little harder from here on, because you don’t know until you know that the person you’re defending is the problem. It lends too much to the ‘but what if she’s lying?’ argument. And now that we know she hasn’t at all been telling the full story, or so it seems thus far in the court case, how do we react?

Do people react to domestic partner abuse in the same way that they do when the person being abused is a man? Not at all. I am sure we were all surprised when the stories started to surface, and Depp countersued. No one expected he would actually have a case, much less go through with it. Much like the Chris Brown-Rihanna drama (when Chris Brown said in his Netflix documentary that they were both being violent towards each other, mostly stemming from their violent upbringings), there is a definite shift when it would appear that both parties were wrong.

Personally, I don’t know what to think. It’s a sad situation when you see people in relationships getting together and they very much should not be together. Why do people stay? I don’t know. Why did Depp stay? Why did Rihanna? These are superstars in their own right and if they left, they would have the money, resources, support, and options to go on and thrive in their own lives. It makes you wonder about how, if Hollywood millionaires can’t leave, how are ordinary joes – johnnies - doing it?

The Depp case, for me, is a stark reminder that abuse is not a one-way street. Let us not let our personal bias make us ignore the fact that this is happening to men, too, as surprising as it may sound. Let’s make a little space for people – men, specifically, to admit what’s happening and leave, instead of laughing at men who are harassed or abused. And though this seems obvious – if someone slices your finger off, that’s a field of red flags, or whatever the collective noun is. Run.

Wangu Kanuri




The Bar, Hotels and Liquor Traders Association (BAHLITA) has blamed the effects of Covid-19 on the rise in the number of people being drugged (“mchele”) before being defrauded.

They said liquor is a luxury that many Kenyans avoided at the height of the pandemic but now they can purchase it and some drinkers are overindulging.

But measures have been adopted to curb mchele cases, said BAHLITA secretary general Boniface Gachoka.

“We have written to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti to provide a team of officers who will help [eliminate] this booming business.”

He said BAHLITA would work with the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya to identify chemists selling the drugs to people involved in the mchele business.

Echoing the need to eradicate mchele in bars, Daniel Ouma, the chairperson BAHLITA’s Kisumu branch, said they had asked bar owners to install CCTV cameras and educate waiters, managers and bouncers on first-aid care.

“Once a client has been noted to be sleepy or drowsy, the first thing should be to wake them up and if he is not responding offer first aid,” he advised.

“If the person responsible for [lacing] the drink can be identified, liaise with the police and track the suspect, if not post them on social media platforms.”

The drugs are mainly used during surgery as an anaesthetic and for treating psychosis. High doses can cause deaths, permanent amnesia, and sleepiness that can last several days.

In the last two weeks, men across social media platforms have lamented the use of mchele, with some disclosing that they had lost their properties and money.

Addressing issues affecting bar owners, BAHLITA, led by its chair Simon Njoroge, complained about proposed increases in excise duty on beer and spirits, saying that if the taxes are adopted there would be an increase in the illicit alcohol trade as Kenyans would start smuggling cheap products from other markets.

The National Treasury, in the Finance Bill 2022, proposes to increase excise duty on alcoholic beverages at these rates: beer, 10 percent; spirits 20 percent; glass bottles, new excise tax of 25 percent. It also wants a 15 percent rise in advertising fees for alcohol products.

“The government should be cognisant of the current hard economic times that Kenyans are going through and not burden them further through harsh laws that risk pushing thousands of Kenyans out of jobs. The proposed excise duty will not only affect manufacturers and farmers but also businesses and consumers,” Mr Njoroge said.

Claiming that 250,000 people working in bars and hotels had lost their jobs during the Covid period and only 15,000 are currently employed, Mr Njoroge warned the government that this number would decrease if they pass the bill to increase taxes.

“Beer is a primary consumer of barley and sorghum. With the decline in beer volumes, farmers will be forced to cut down production hence loss of livelihoods.”

On reducing noise pollution from entertainment zones, Mr Njoroge said they are encouraging the creation of WhatsApp groups where bar owners and neighbours can air their grievances.

On alleged racism at some clubs, with the most recent incident involving Alchemist in Westlands, Nairobi, BAHLITA condemned such behaviour, commending Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu’s decision to close it down and the claims are investigated.

Walking into Mawimbi Seafood Restaurant and Café, one gets the experience of being in the Coast. Mawimbi is the 2021 World Luxury Restaurant Award winner by no fluke.

A meal can set you back from Sh10,000 to few hundred.

As soon as you get to the front door, beige fabrics hang on the ceiling in forms that remind you of the sandy shores.

This leads you to the Crudo Bar (serves raw dishes), which introduces you to the bites. You could share a sushi roll with a friend or partner as an appetiser. It could also be the main dish. 

The second part of the restaurant, the fine dining area, has amber-coloured light bulbs with lampshades resembling sails. This gives the aura of sailing boats with the sun setting behind them. 

The poolside at the gazebos – the VIP area – has canvasses that give the feel of ocean waves and sails of boats. The landscape includes palm trees.

The detail to architectural design is a precursor to how the restaurant pays attention to customers’ experience. The windows and door done in coastal designs – including arcs – are made of white-coloured wood that still maintains its natural texture. 

The walls are decked with white coral bricks to give the feeling and sense of being in the Coast.

Carlos Espindola, the Ecuadorian head chef and executive chef at Mawimbi, has been in the restaurant business for more than 20 years. The 37-year-old has risen through the ranks of the hospitality and eatery industry, including management.

“Food critics travel around the world and find restaurants. We were surprised. We expected to win in East Africa but not a global award. This has put Kenya on the map. It is a big achievement for the country. Usually, winners come from Europe, North America or Michelin star restaurants in Asia. We’re going for more awards and are ready to face challenges,” Espindola says.

He pursued his undergraduate studies in Culinary Arts at Cafam University in Bogota, Colombia, graduating in 2003. Espindola then moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he earned his master’s in 2007. 

Other than working at Ecuadorian restaurants, he also had a stint with luxury hotel chain SLS Baha in Nassau, the Bahamas, where he was  restaurant manager and would deliver food to two pools; Bungalow and Privilege. 

He also worked at Umami Burger (Umami is the Japanese word for “fifth flavour”– a rich and savoury taste sensation beyond the commonplace).

Espindola has worked at a pop up restaurant that holds events and offered catering services using the farm-to-plate format in Ecuador. The owner of that restaurant, Chef Ariel Moscardi, who also owns Cultiva Kenya, recommended Espindola to Mawimbi directors.

He arrived in July 2019 and by August 2019, Mawimbi was operational as a fine dining restaurant. It was officially opened in November 2019.

“Then Covid-i9 came and we had to close. It was difficult because we had invested a lot of money, time, effort and love in this place,” Espindola says. 

“After a month of closure due to the lockdown, we started to push deliveries. That was challenging but it made us survive.”

This is what led the directors to add the word “café” to the establishment. They realised they had to include a menu that was affordable to their clients during the hard times. 

Mawimbi has retained some of that affordable menu even after reopening with Covid-19 protocols being observed. The 200-seater restaurant only accommodates 70 customers at a time.

Carlos Espindola, the head chef and executive chef at Mawimbi Seafood Restaurant and Cafe, with the establishment's General Manager Cecilia Kamau display a framed certificate of their 2021 World Luxury Restaurant Award.

“The idea of Mawimbi was always to change menus and not bore customers. We want to create excitement for our guests. They should expect different and new stuff,” Espindola says. 

“We are creating a coastal culture, especially here in Nairobi where seafood is rare. Nairobians mostly eat tilapia or fresh water fish. We want to make people open their pallets to local fish. We  work with Coast fishermen to ensure weekly delivery of fresh supplies.”

The restaurant promotes sustainable fishing. Even with some fish being mandatory on the menu, the process must be 100 per cent sustainable.

“In the beginning, they sold us small lobsters but these are the babies of the ocean. I had to go there and agree with them to supply the big ones. I told them there wouldn’t be any more lobster in 15 to 20 years if they continued with the practice,” Espindola says. 

Cold vans bring the fish from the Coast to Mawimbi. Half of the team of chefs is also from the Coast.

They have a lot of experience that Espindola says has been a learning experience for him as well. He has learnt to prepare Swahili dishes, fusing it with his style. That makes the Mawimbi experience a fusion of Latin American, Swahili and Asian cultures.

Because people are keen on trying new dishes, experiences, texture, protein and flavours, Espindola has found himself explaining to guests where the fish comes from, how it is prepared and even how it should be eaten.

“Half of our dishes are raw while the other half are cooked. How the chef and suppliers work or pack as they process the seafood ensures no poisoning,” Espindola says. 

“Some people may not know they have allergies. The first thing we do at the table is ask if they have any specific conditions. That makes us prepare meals to their requirements.”

One of Mawimbi customers’ most popular meals is ceviche – or seviche – a seafood dish that originated in Peru.

It is typically made from fresh raw fish cured in fresh citrus juices – usually lemon or lime – but historically the juice of bitter orange.

“Ceviche appeared by mistake as a way of preserving food. Our ancestors would put fish in salt and then later flavour it with pilipili (pepper). Once you put all these ingredients in the fish, it sort of marinates and kills most of the bacteria,” Espindola says. 

“Also sushi is served with wasabi (Japanese horseradish) that helps digest the raw seafood,” he says, adding that the signature dish is Poseidon Seafood Plate which has grilled lobster, seasonal prawns, octopus, calamari and roasted oyster.

A plate of Poseidon Seafood goes for Sh5, 600. It comes with bearnaise sauce, chimichurri, rucola, cherry tomato salad and skinny fries. 

Wagyu Beef goes for Sh9,800 and contains Australian steak (250g), Josper grilled (a hybrid grill). That means it has the flavour of the grill and the controlled cooking temperature of the oven) to perfection (medium), charred onions and mushrooms, szechuan pepper sauce.

Besides the skinny fries, you can have a side of Cassava and Mojo Mash. Either goes for Sh360.

Freedom Ceviche (Red snapper, crunchy calamari, green tiger milk, coconut milk, aji amarillo paste, “chifles” green plantain crisps) is pocket-friendly at Sh1,700 Though most feedback is positive, Espindola says critical assessment is important for growth and improvement.

“Nothing can be perfect to everyone,” the chef says.

Here are a few tips to get you started:

Set the massage table or a soft surface to relax on

Firstly, you want your partner to be comfortable. Make sure the surface you choose is soft and won't cause any pain or discomfort.

Secondly, the area should be accessible to you. The too-high massage table will mean you strain to reach your partner.

With the massage area set, work on stimulating your partner's senses: sight, taste, smell, touch, and sound.

Sight

Creating a relaxing and sensual atmosphere is key to a successful massage. Set the scene by dimming the lights and using candles. This will set a relaxing mood. Scented candles are perfect for this.

Add visual stimulation by using massage oils that come in assorted colours. This will give your partner something to look at while you are massaging them.

Additionally, wear something revealing.

If you have the time and inclination, make a little video of yourself giving your partner the massage. This will get them excited about the experience!

Smell

Use essential oils or aromatherapy to stimulate your partner's sense of smell. This will help them relax and get in the mood for a massage.

There are a variety of oils to choose from, find one that your partner likes. Or experiment with a few different scents until you find one that works for both of you.

Taste

Having drinks such as wine, juice, or water on hand can increase the relaxation and sensuality of your massage. Offering sips to your partner during the massage is a great way to keep them hydrated and relaxed.

You could also try edible oils or lotions to add another dimension of taste to your massage.

Sound

Some people find that listening to calming music or nature sounds helps them relax during a massage. If this is the case for your partner, play calming music in the background.

Touch

The most important aspect of massage is touch. The right type of touch can relax your partner and get them in the mood for more.

Start with gentle strokes and work your way up to firmer pressure as the massage progresses. Use different strokes to keep things interesting for both of you.

Get started

First, let your partner take a shower or bath.

For better understanding, read about the basic massage techniques. There are various massage methods to choose from.

Pour massage oil into your hands, rub gently, and start with their back. These are often the areas that get most tense.

Next, work your way down their body, taking time to massage each muscle group.

Use different strokes and pressure to achieve the best results.

Finish by massaging their feet and legs to improve blood circulation and promote relaxation.

Focus on easy-to-forget areas, such as the ears, behind the knees, wrists, face, and jaws.

Take it a notch higher

Once you are comfortable with giving massages, why not take it up a notch?

Incorporate sensual massage techniques into your routine to increase intimacy and sexual tension between you and your partner.


It is Valentine’s Day. This is the day of love, flowers, chocolates, candlelight dinners, bubble baths, and lots of sex. In fact, sex is as synonymous with Valentine’s as the colour red.


Where pornography is an issue in the relationship, there will tend to be another bigger issue hiding beneath the surface. 


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.


From 25 per cent households headed by a single parent in 2009, the number had shot to a staggering four out of 10 three years ago


This will be Ms Karua's first visit to Nyanza since she was unveiled as Mr Odinga's running mate.

159,News,"Liverpool fans stand outside unable to get in in time leading to the match being delayed prior to the Uefa Champions League final match between Liverpool and Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, north of Paris, on May 28, 2022.


By 
AFP




President Emmanuel Macron urged the French government on Wednesday to investigate with ""full transparency"" the chaos at last weekend's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, as the interior minister came under increasing pressure over the police's handling.

The mayhem outside the Stade de France stadium ahead of the match, which saw thousands of Liverpool supporters with tickets struggle to enter and police respond with tear gas, raised questions over the capacity of Paris to host the Olympic Games in 2024.

French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who has faced accusations of lying after he blamed the chaos on massive ticket scams, admitted that the organisation could ""clearly"" have been better.

Government spokeswoman Olivia Gregoire said that the matter had been briefly discussed at Wednesday's regular cabinet meeting chaired by Macron, who has yet to comment publicly.

""What the president wants... is that light is shone on what really happened, in full transparency, and very quickly,"" she told reporters, while emphasising Darmanin had Macron's ""full confidence"".

She said Macron also expected action from the government to ensure that this ""never happens again"".

""Simply put, could we have done things better, could it have been better managed? Yes,"" she acknowledged. ""Were there wounded, a tragedy? No. Can we improve things for future sporting events? Certainly.""

She confirmed that 2,700 supporters had been unable to watch the match due to the chaos.

""The president of the republic and all his government are sad and sorry for these people who lost out.""

Despite the public professions of support, French media reports said that Macron was privately furious with Darmanin, 39, a high-flying right-winger.

The Canard Enchaine satirical weekly said that Macron had told Darmanin that what happened was a ""heavy blow for France"".

""We can say that he was furious,"" BFM TV cited a source close to Macron as saying.

""The minister of the interior was expressly asked to step up and stop insisting that we were not to blame,"" the source added.

Darmanin and Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera appeared later Wednesday before a Senate committee hearing facing questions about security at the game, which tarnished France's image ahead of its hosting of the rugby World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2024.

Appearing to adopt a slightly more conciliatory tone in his initial remarks, Darmanin admitted there had been shortcomings.

""Clearly things could have been organised better. It is evident that this celebration of sport was ruined and we very much regret the troubles which were sometimes unacceptable,"" he said.

""For the football fans the negative image of this match wounded our national pride,"" he said.

""Did we avoid the worst? Yes. Could we have prepared better? Without doubt,"" he said.

Darmanin said that as many as 70 percent of tickets were found to be fraudulent by staff at the first security checkpoints outside the Stade de France.

Brandishing a real ticket and fake ticket to make his point, Darmanin said that some entry tickets had been forged by tricksters hundreds of times over.

And he expressed regret over the ""disproportionate"" use of tear gas, saying ""sanctions will be taken"" against the officers in charge.

French far-right leader Marine Le Pen suggested Darmanin should resign after he defended the French police and blamed ticket counterfeiting for the chaos.

""The facts are extremely serious and the lie by the minister is extremely serious,"" Le Pen told France 2 television.

""In any other democracy, faced with such a fiasco, with chaos that occurred in front of 400 million people watching on television, which offered a dreadful image of France, then he should consider himself that he should resign,"" she added.

The leftwing Liberation newspaper depicted Darmanin on its front page on Wednesday with his nose stretched out like Pinocchio.

The newspaper's editorial, headlined ""Lie"", said the final ""risks remaining in the annals of the republic long even after it has been forgotten by football fans.""

The scenes have caused renewed tensions between France and Britain, whose ties are already strained, and have become a domestic political headache for the government less than two weeks before parliamentary elections.

158,News,"US actor Johnny Depp and his former wife Amber Heard. PHOTO | FILE | AFP


By 
AFP




A libel trial was due to begin on Tuesday between Hollywood actor Johnny Depp and a British tabloid newspaper over claims that he was violent to his former wife, Amber Heard.

Depp, 57, is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN), publisher of The Sun, and its executive editor Dan Wootton for an April 2018 article which referred to him as a ""wife beater"".

The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star strenuously denies the accusation.

The case, which was delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak, will be heard over 15 days at the High Court in London.

The couple settled a divorce out of court in 2017. She donated a settlement of $7 million (£5.6 million, 6.2 million euros) to charity.

Depp denies being abusive towards Heard, 34, and has brought separate libel proceedings against her in the United States.

As well as Depp and Heard, his former partners Vanessa Paradis, the French singer, and the actress Winona Ryder are due to give evidence.

In pre-trial witness statements Paradis -- his former long-time partner with whom he has two children -- has described the actor as ""kind"" and ""non-violent"".

Ryder said she could not ""wrap my head around"" Heard's accusations that Depp was abusive.

NGN failed last week in a last-ditch bid to have the case dismissed, arguing Depp was in breach of a court order for failing to disclose documents from the US case.

Nicol, who will rule on the case, agreed he was in breach but decided the trial should go ahead nonetheless.

The Sun is relying in its defence on 14 separate claims of domestic violence that Heard alleges occurred between early 2013 and May 2016.

During pre-trial hearings, NGN lawyers said Depp had failed to hand over details of text messages from 2015, which allegedly referred to drug-taking.

They argued they were ""profoundly damaging to his case"".

The messages were sent shortly before what Heard has claimed was a ""three-day ordeal of physical assaults"" in Australia, the court heard.

Judge Nicol had previously refused an application by Depp's legal team to require Heard to disclose evidence, including a secret recording of a conversation with the actor.

The request also involved communications between Heard and ""Rocketman"", a contact saved in her phone who Depp claims is the SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk, as well as with actor James Franco.

Depp's lawyer David Sherborne told the court last week that Heard had affairs with both Musk and Franco while she was going out with or married to his client.

The couple met on the set of the 2011 film ""The Rum Diary"" and married in February 2015.

North West Leopards from South Africa land in the country Thursday morning ahead of the historic Currie Cup Division One clash with Kenya Simbas on Saturday at the RFUEA ground.

The Leopards will arrive at 6am for the duel that will witness the Currie Cup being played outside South Africa for the first time.

The Simbas, who have been in South Africa for close to two months, are back in the country, with the last batch of players expected to jet in Tuesday night.

The Simbas will play the last two of their Currie Cup matches in Nairobi against the Leopards before meeting Eastern Province Elephants on June 11.

All the matches in the battle dubbed the ""Nairobi Series"" will be played at the RFUEA ground.

Raymond Oruo of Direct Sports Management, a firm that is marketing the Currie Cup Nairobi Series, disclosed that entry fee is Sh1,000 for regular seating and Sh2,000 for VIP.

Oruo said that the duel will kick off at 4pm and that there will be no build up matches so as to preserve the status of the field.

“It’s currently raining and we want the pitch to be in pristine condition,” said Oruo, adding that any changes to the program will be communicated.    

Kenya Simbas have only one win from their seven outings and are currently placed ninth in the log with eight points.  

The Simbas lost their opening match to Falcons 51-14 on April 9 before going down to Zimbabwe 22-21 on April 23 and Griffons 66-33 on April 30.

However, they made their presence felt when they claimed their first win, beating Border Bulldogs 35-12 on May 7 at Fort Hare Stadium.

They would at one point tie the duel at 25-25 before losing to Boland Cavaliers 45-33 on May 21.

The Simbas lost their 7-0 lead against South Western Districts (SWD) Eagles before going down 24-7 on Saturday.

Kenya Simbas coach Paul Odera was impressed with the team's performance so far.

“We are happy with the progress we have made. The conditions were difficult in the opening 40 minutes, but we played well in the second half. We now need to take our chances and minimize our errors at crucial times,” said Odera.

Kenya is using the South African competition to prepare for the 2022 Rugby Africa Cup slated for July 1-10 in France. The Africa Cup will also serve as the 2023 World Cup qualifiers.

The Leopards are seventh with three wins and four losses, while Elephants are second with 26 wins drawn from five wins and two loses.

The Northern Free State Griffons, who enjoy an unbeaten run, top the 10-team standings with 39 points from eight wins.

The top four teams will advance to the semi-finals on June 18 with the final due on June 25.

South Africa Rugby tournament director Yusuf Jackson was in the country on May 3 to launch the Currie Cup “Nairobi Series.”

Jackson was accompanied by Eastern Province Rugby chief executive officer, Thando Manana and Elephants Rugby counterpart, Eugene Fourie.

156,News,"Family Bank officials during the opening of a branch in Isiolo. Kenyan lenders opened new branches in rural counties last year in a bid to expand their branch network and boost their physical presence.


By 
Brian Ambani


Nation Media Group



Kenyan lenders opened new branches in rural counties last year in a bid to expand their branch network and boost their physical presence despite the increasing shift by customers from brick-and-mortar banking to the fast and convenient digital models.

Data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows that local banks opened three new branches in the rural counties of Isiolo and Trans Nzoia each and two branches in each of Embu, Kericho, Nyeri and Taita Taveta to increase their brand presence in those counties and cater to customers that still rely on traditional banking for their banking transactions.

The choice of opening new bank branches in these counties also appears strategic as most of them are agricultural-rich areas with major cash crops such as maize, tea and coffee meaning they have high cash circulation.

Banks also opened a branch in Baringo, Bungoma, Busia, Machakos and Nandi each even as the banking sector regulator noted that the presence of a physical branch network continues to denote a stable and reliable banking system in parts of the work despite the rapid growth of alternative banking channels. 

However, the total number of bank branches decreased 2.86 per cent from 1,502 in 2020, to 1,459 in 2021, which translates to a fall of 43 branches with Nairobi registering the highest decline in the number of branches by 33 and Mombasa by nine branches. 

“The decrease in bank branches is mainly attributed to closure of branches by some commercial banks due to adoption of alternative delivery channels including agency banking, mobile phone banking, and internet banking,” said CBK.

By 
Brian Ocharo




A 25-year dispute between the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and a hotel developer in Malindi could leave the taxpayer with a Sh2.1 billion bill.

The High Court recently ordered the agency to compensate Sea Star Malindi Ltd for the demolition of its property in November 1997.

KWS June 1 lamented that it would be left in dire financial straits should the firm be allowed to enforce the judgment.

“The decretal Sh2.1 billion is a colossal sum and if the respondent commences execution, it will cripple the agency’s functions of conservation and management of parks which are funded by the taxpayers,” it said.

The multimillion-shilling hotel was reportedly illegally flattened on KWS orders, even after being issued with approvals to develop the property.

The company claims that being the registered owner of a beach plot in Malindi, it applied to the defunct municipality for a permit to construct a five-star hotel in 1996. Upon receipt of the permit and necessary approvals, it embarked on the construction of the same.

But in November 1997, KWS game rangers stormed the property and stopped the construction. They kept guard and ensured no activities took place. The firm said the construction of the hotel was to be completed in December of the same year.

“The activities of KWS have occasioned heavy financial losses as the firm has been unable to complete the hotel, which was already halfway built and or to repay the loans borrowed for purposes of carrying out the construction,” it said

Despite demand made and notice of intention to sue, the company said KWS persisted in their occupation of the suit premises hence making it necessary to file the case.

In 2018, the Environment and Land Court (ELC) ordered KWS to compensate the firm Sh90 million, being the cost of the reconstruction of the hotel and general damages of Sh30 million, with interest until payment in full and costs of the suit.

KWS was not satisfied with the award, but delayed to appeal. It then returned to the court to apply for an extension of time to file the appeal.

KWS said it delayed filing its record of appeal because it was not served with relevant documents in time, such as certified typed proceedings from the ELC. “The agency would, therefore, suffer grave prejudice if it is not allowed to pursue its right to appeal,” it said.

Sea Star Malindi Ltd Director Michele Marchioro opposed the application, noting that no plausible reason had been given to enable the court to extend time.

Through lawyer Kevin Anami, Mr Marchioro argued that KWS failed to explain why two years since the agency was allowed to appeal against the award, it had not taken steps to move the appeal forward.

“The instant application was a delaying tactic, especially in light of the fact that two of the company’s   three directors were octogenarians and KWS’ intention is, therefore, to permanently deny us justice,” said Mr Anami.

The firm also disputed the accuracy of the Sh2.1 billion cited by KWS.

He also lamented that the dispute has been in the High Court for over 20 years and the company had suffered substantial financial loss in litigating the case and shall suffer great prejudice if the application is allowed, as it will amount to rewarding KWS’s unjust conduct.

Lawyers Kiragu Kimani and Titus Mugambi for KWS claimed that the said property was public land and that it was justified to stop the construction, which was being undertaken on a legally protected area that is adjacent to the area designated as Malindi Marine National Reserve and Park.

Court of Appeal Judge Pauline Nyamweya, however, allowed KWS’s application for an extension of time, arguing that the reason for the delay was satisfactory.

“On the whole, the reasons proffered by KWS for the various delays are reasonable, and the agency has demonstrated the steps it has taken in moving its appeal. The delay is, therefore, excusable and not inordinate,” said the judge.

She also said there are interventions that are available to mitigate and address any prejudice during the pendency of an appeal, which he said are the more appropriate course of action in balancing the interests of both parties and in the interests of substantive justice in the circumstances.

Rupi Mangat


The Nandi chief who resisted their land being grabbed at the turn of the 20th century is celebrated here

The mausoleum was opened in 2005 by the then President Mwai Kibaki.



It’s a cool afternoon atop Nandi Hills. While the golfers take to the first tee at the picturesque Nandi Bears Club boasting the most scenic fairways lined with towering indigenous trees, we walk the short distance into the museum dedicated to the famous Nandi leader, Koitalel Arap Samoei.

Portrait of Koitalel arap Samoei, Nandi leader in the museum in Nandi Hills Town. Photo | Rupi Mangat

The mausoleum was opened in 2005 by the then President Mwai Kibaki. Stepping inside the impressive building, it’s large but empty, save for the four pillars and the grave of the chief. 

Killed in cold blood on 19 October 1905 by the British administrator, Colonel Meinertzhagen near the mausoleum on the grounds of the present-day golf club, Koitalel’s head was severed and sent to England. It hasn’t been returned. The Nandi were opposed to their land being taken for the railway, understandably so. 

The curator, Francis K. Thalam escorts us around the single-storey colonial house by the mausoleum which served as a court house before being turned into a museum.

At first glance, the single-room museum looks completely uninteresting with the few artefacts and pictures – and if you don’t know anything about the history, it’s easy to ignore it.

But Thalam narrates the events from the past. The three long staffs that belonged to the Nandi leader still stand encased in the glass and metal box that I saw on my first visit, more than a decade ago. They were symbols of Samoei’s government, each representing the administration, military and religion. Taken away from the community to England by the colonial power, the three staffs were returned after many decades.

The house is now called Barsirian Manyei, named after the leader’s son who became a freedom fighter. Barsirian Arap Manyei (1882 – 10 April 1974) was the last widely recognised Nandi Orkoiyot (leader) and Kenya's longest serving political detainee.  Captured by the colonial British, Barsirian spent 40 years in exile, shuttled from prison to prison to places like Mfangano and Rusinga, the islands of Lake Victoria, Kapsabet and the far-flung Meru.  

Maosoleum of Koitalel arap Samoei, Nandi leader in Nandi Hills Town. Photo | Rupi Mangat

When Barsirian was supposed to be brought back to Nandi Hills, the colonial government sensed trouble – the Nandi would demand the release of their leader. Hence, Barsirian was shipped back to Mfangano Island – and only released after Kenya’s independence. In 1974, Barsirian moved to Uasin Gishu.

An array of sepia images show the Nandi men who played a part in history with artefacts collected by Thalam dating back a century or more like the 500-year-old buffalo hide shields. A clawless African otter on display was an animal revered by the Nandi because it led the people to clean water – remember in those days there were no taps or indoor plumbing.

An Ethiopian jiko resembles the Nandi jiko which Thalam has a theory about, that the Nandi followed the Nile into Kenya.

A keen anthropologist, Thalam a Kalenjin has published two books about his community. 

A slight drizzle begins as we walk back to the golf club. This time we vanish into the pine woodland being cleared. We’re searching for the spot where Koitalel was murdered in cold blood.

Our guide stops at a huge boulder in the planted forest of tall trees. “This is where the Nandi leader used to hold court,” tells our guide. The place where Koitalel Arap Samoei was murdered is not the same spot but in another area unknown to our guide.

Driving down Nandi Hills through the long winding road wedged between the steep hills and valleys, there’s a spectacular show of rain and lightning from Tinderet, turning the skies an electric white with fiery red rods.

Check in at Kweisos House or Nandi Bears Club for golfers, exploring the many sites on the long stretch of Nandi Hills like the Bonjoge National Park also called the Nandi Rock, South Nandi Forest for hiking, birding and cultural tours like the museum dedicated to the Nandi leader Koitalel arap Samoei, the prehistoric sites of Songhor and Fort Ternan, including the 1903 Uganda Railway relics at Fort Ternan.

Title: These Words: An Anthology of Poems

Author: Kivutha Kibwana

Year of Publication: 2021

Publisher: One Planet Publishing & Media Services

Length: 117 pages

Available: In leading bookshop countrywide

Reviewer: Makau Kitata

The foreword to Kivutha Kibwana’s 2021 anthology of poems, These Words, published by One Planet, is an interesting attempt by a writer to speak to the reader and explain why he wrote. This theme has occupied creative minds and thoroughly theorised by George Orwell, the author of Animal Farm and 1984.

There are several reasons why people write: For egoistic purposes – just to be better than one’s peers; for aesthetic purposes – to merely enjoy a musical turn of phrase; for historical purposes – for those inclined to recording important moments in time; and for political reasons – to influence others. Orwell recommends balancing these reasons. Yet, all committed writing is political: The writer aims at influencing the readers’ way of looking at the world.

Kibwana has many tributes and attributes: He is a politician and an academic; his style of leadership and publications on constitutional law are part of his public image. The least celebrated is his place as a creative artist. He has written plays, poetry in Kikamba and English, and published creative content on YouTube. So, what has he done with writing a foreword to his poetry?

In doing so, the poet diminishes the distance between the person writing and the voice behind the poems; the virtual personality that the reader hears, independent of the writer – the persona. In a creative work this threatens the universality of the experience. The dangers of erasing the distance between person and voice are easy to see. Supposing one writes a moral lesson in the work, then fails to uphold the moral values. 

These poems were conceived in the 1990s and 2000s, a period, according to the foreword, of betrayal and hopelessness in life. This period in Kenya’s history marked an opening in democracy in Kenya, characterised with a burst of creative energies: The Kamirithu players replayed Ngugi’s plays in bars and motels; plays in vernacular became acceptable in mainstream theatres; story tellers like Wahome Mutahi could hardly satisfy the thirst for well told stories; even the presidency was satirised by the Redykyulass group. Meanwhile, poets were at work, though less visible.

Cover of the book ‘These Words: An Anthology of Poems’ by Prof Kivutha Kibwana.

Kibwana wrote the poems in the anthology as a response to a sudden creative compulsion. Wordsworth has said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions, recollected in tranquility. Kibwana’s foreword claims that he wrote the poems in solitude to tame his emotions. This underlines one of the basic uses of poetry: As medicine that allows us some precious respite, allowing us to remain alive and mentally healthy. 

The movements in the anthology mark phases of personal, social and political moments of self-discovery. The poem, ‘For Kichamu and Others’ is a memory to colleagues at the Centre for Law Research International (CLARION); an outfit Kibwana founded with Kichamu Akivaga, Willy Mutunga, Smokin Wanjala and others in the 90s. That community is memorialised in a poem that documents the start of structured action for constitutional and political change in 1992. It is a poem about friends who met in a bar, disillusioned, and cynical as a result of the stifling vagaries of the Moi dictatorship. The poem is not merely a memory, but a call to arms upon the members to raise themselves and overcome pain and become combatants in the spirit of Lenin. 

The poet’s anxieties are captured in the many poems that are a meditation on death, suggesting that it is only after reconciling with the idea of death that life can have a meaning. The 90s were times of death, especially of children, the youth and political activists. There is a poem on street children, ‘Kyanguli,’ last respects to university students killed by the Nyayo regime like Solomon Muruli, Festo Etaba, Okeng’o Kenneth, Makokha Mutabi, and Eric Mutwiri Kamundi. But these poems are also about the living youths of Kenya. They are eulogies with epitaphs that recall Langston Hughes’ famous poem, “What Happens to a Dream Differed?” 

Youth in Kenya is imagined metaphorically in the poem titled ‘Youth Seed’. In a society where adolescence is a dangerous stage in life, the poet philosophises that, ‘you cannot kill a future yet to unfold.’ Poetry on the formative years is about finding oneself and making choices. Kibwana has created a boy persona – KK and RM, every Boy, whom he advises to take responsibility with phrases like: man yourself, and adult yourself . The girl persona, Lulu, is every Girl in the anthology. Through her, he delves into the delicate topic of love, advising her not to fear loving, alongside the certainty that she will wean from its hurts.

The poet’s understanding of love is profound: Love is a sacred void where God sows a craving quest. Therefore, compatibility and estrangement are the fibre of that incompleteness of divine creation called love. It is a sobering lesson to discover, through poetry, that love is incompleteness.

The poems dedicated to a persona called Nazi are a straight tribute to Kibwana’s wife. In these poems, she becomes Nazi; every Woman; the embodiment of comradeship in youth and old age. The poet confesses his indebtedness to the lovingly stubborn social support of a woman when he is on the verge of being destroyed by disappointment, and disillusionment, war with a lunatic state, and disenchantment – induced-alcoholism. In poetry, the poet is able to admit his vulnerability and submission to things stronger than any man; like liquor and love. Ironically, the poet seems only to have discovered the love of Nazi in old age. 

In poems documenting rampant political violence, the poet memorialises Father John Anthony Kaiser, Wagalla, Kikuyu, Rwanda and the ironical new year’s Kesha in Kiambaa. This culminates into the poet’s redefinition of IDP as ‘Independent Determined Person’, which is an indictment to the irony of Kenya’s independence that allows one to be displaced from the home.

The poetry celebrates the heroes of Kenya – from the humble to the militant. Kijana Wamwala is worth remembering because he was always simple, while the memory of Dedan Kimathi is significantly deconstructed. When Kibwana was serving as a minister in Kibaki’s government, the Kimathi monument was erected on Kimathi Street next to Kimathi House.

In the poetry, the spirit of Kimathi does not ask for a monument, a name on a street or a public building. It asks for a free country; a free people. Even as he was quietly toeing the line as a minister, Kibwana was privately extending a revolutionary angle to meanings in Kenya. This heroes corner includes poems for Mukami Kimathi and Willy Mutunga that ask the reader: “Have you ever wondered why we praise heroes when they expire? It is because they make no demands on our national conscience.” This theme on heroes is capped with the poem on Timothy Njoya, drawn as a messenger against State House and pulpit pharaohs, a testament to the role of the clergy in Kenyan politics.

It is uplifting to read from a prominent Kenyan who has chosen poetry as a form to document his life.

Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera described it as massive as he named his side to face South Africa's North West Leopards in their penultimate match of the Currie Cup First Division on Saturday at the RFUEA.

“It’s massive...massive! It's a moment of pride and nervousness as well,” said Odera, who made several changes to the squad that lost to  South Western Districts (SWD) Eagles 24-7 on Saturday.

Just hours after arriving in the country, Leopards coach André Pretorius also unleashed his squad for the Simbas battle where he expects a physical but thrilling display.

This is the first time in history that the Currie Cup will be played outside South Africa.

The Leopards duel will see the return of second rowers Emmanuel Silungi, who has just arrived in the country from Israel and Davis Chenge, who has recovered from an injury.

Open side flanker Dan Sikuta reclaims captain’s armband with half backs Samuel Asati and Dominic Coulson, and fullback Darwin Mukidza also returning to the starting lineup.

Odera noted that there has been good progress in conditioning and mental strength of the team since they traveled to South Africa in April for the Currie Cup.

“The set pieces have always been an area of concern but we are much better and consistent,” explained Odera. “Our scrums were at 50 to 60 percent when we got to the Currie Cup but we are now heading to 90 to 100 percent...they are not quality but we are retaining our own possession.”

Kenya Simbas centre Vincent Onyala (left) charges past scrum half Geoffrey Ominde (centre) as John Okoth looks on during their training session at Impala Club on June 2, 2022 ahead of their Currie Cup First Division against South Africa's North West Leopards to be played at RFUEA ground in Nairobi on Saturday.





However, Odera said the lineouts are where they need to get to 80 or 90 percent because South African teams are perhaps the best in the world in that department.

“Elite performance takes time, it’s not a magic rod that someone waves to expect change overnight. We need to keep on going to South Africa if we want to go to the World Cup,” noted Odera.

Odera said it has been a massive journey for his players since April and hopes Currie Cup experience will help the Kenyan players also know what rugby means to South Africa.

Describing it as a leap of faith, Odera commended Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Oduor Gangla for ensuring that the team participated in Currie Cup.

“Even after missing the opener against Georgia, the chairman assured us that the trip was still on. It was all about leadership, vision and bravery, and well done to Gangla,” said Odera, who also commended South Africa Rugby for coming on board.

Odera said there is a lot Kenya has to learn from South Africa, who are World champions for a good reason. “They have a robust set up from schools, provinces to the national team.""

Pretorius commended Kenya for seeking South Africa’s help and advice on their quest to reach the 2023 Paris Rugby World Cup.

“I am proud of what Kenya Simbas have achieved hence any opposition coming against Kenya now is in big trouble. Kenya really needs to get it right completely this week. Their set pieces are good and they need to keep on working on them,” said Pretorius .

Brian Ngugi




KCB Group net earnings grew by over half in the first quarter ended March, helped by higher interest, non-interest income and lower loan loss provisions.

The lender’s net profit in the period stood at Sh9.9 billion up from Sh6.4 billion the year before.

Outgoing CEO Joshua Oigara said the results reflected resilience in a tough environment.

“During the quarter, the business showed sustained resilience backed by our proactive approach towards driving income growth, managing liquidity, conservation of capital, and cost containment,” he said in a statement yesterday evening.

“Furthermore, a relentless focus on our strategy has enabled us to maintain robust asset growth and deliver healthy return on our investments,” the chief executive said.

KCB net interest income grew by 18 per cent to Sh19.7 billion driven by increase in net loans and advances coupled with growth in investments in government securities even as its non-funded income expanded by 47.2 percent to Sh9.3 billion.

Provisions decreased by 27.5 per cent from a similar period last year largely due to a drop in corporate and digital lending impairment charge after Covid-19 related provisions recognised in the full year 2021, said the lender. 

This is Mr Oigara’s last financial reporting.

KCB Group on Tuesday appointed Paul Russo as its new chief executive officer, replacing Mr Oigara’s who exits after a decade. He joined KCB in 2011.

Mr Russo has been managing director of KCB’s subsidiary National Bank of Kenya.

Mr Oigara who will be available to support the new CEO in the interim has grown the bank through acquisitions and expansion of existing operations.

KCB commended Mr Oigara for his service. “He has left a solid legacy for the group across Africa and beyond that is dotted by transformation of millions of lives, enhanced financial inclusion across the region, digital banking innovations and has built a Group that is anchored on sustainable business practices,” KCB group chairman Andrew Wambari Kairu said on Tuesday.

KCB’s performance shows Kenyan banks could set new earning records this year after bumper profits last year attributed to the recovery of the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Equity Group’s net profit grew 33.7 per cent in the first quarter ended March largely on the back of higher interest income.

The bank reported a net income of Sh11.5 billion in the review period, up from Sh8.6 billion a year earlier.

By 
Justus Ochieng'




Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has secured Cabinet slots and a commitment of law change to create the post of Prime Minister, which he will hold, should Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga form the next government.

This was part of the deal Mr Musyoka brokered to seal his return to Azimio after initially protesting his being snubbed for the post of Mr Odinga’s running mate, which went to Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua.

It also emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Mr Musyoka’s return to the fold and his acceptance of the Chief Cabinet Secretary position that had initially been earmarked for him.

The Musyoka camp might also get the Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary post he once held during the Kanu regime.

Sources indicated other ministerial positions fronted by Mr Musyoka are those of Energy, Water, Health and Tourism.

Kanu chairman Gideon Moi, who has been by Mr Musyoka’s side for the two weeks he had severed ties with Azimio, was also reportedly instrumental in the talks that saw Kanu secure some Cabinet slots.

Insiders in Mr Musyoka’s camp yesterday revealed that during the talks steered by the principals, President Kenyatta who chairs the Azimio Council, Mr Odinga and Mr Moi, the Wiper leader held that the Chief CS post was less powerful than the Deputy President position and it would be imperative that a percentage of government be reserved for his side.

Watch: Kalonzo Musyoka rejoins Azimio

Mr Musyoka, the source said, would secure a percentage of government and will “bolster Raila’s national and regional campaign teams” to secure a win for Mr Odinga.

“Kalonzo said he was convinced by the choice of Ms Karua and understood the current political dynamics,” the source added.

The deal that was finalised on Wednesday night saw Mr Musyoka agree to rejoin Azimio yesterday, a position he announced in the presence of Wiper and Kanu leaders at his SKM command centre in Karen, Nairobi.

Thereafter, he joined Mr Odinga for a rally at Mukuru Kwa Njenga in Embakasi South Constituency.

The Musyoka camp had initially called for a structured power sharing pact, urging for the outcome of the talks to be included in the Azimio agreement already deposited with the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties.

Yesterday, Political Parties Registrar Ann Nderitu said, whereas a renegotiation of an agreement is acceptable by law, the Azimio team was yet to make a fresh filing of a renegotiated agreement.

“I’ve not received any new filing. Maybe if there is, they will file it in due course,” Ms Nderitu told the Nation.

At yesterday’s rally, Mr Odinga alluded to his deal with Mr Musyoka, disclosing that the Wiper leader will also have a Cabinet role and will be tasked with coordination of government functions.

“Kalonzo’s role will be like that of Prime Minister. Just as the one I held in the Grand Coalition Government,” Mr Odinga said, opening the lid on the promise to have a law change to implement the expanded executive.

Mr Odinga and President Kenyatta had pushed for the inclusion of the Prime Minister post, two deputies and the appointment of ministers from among MPs in the Building Bridges Initiative constitutional amendments that the courts threw out.

Yesterday, the Wiper leader officially dropped his presidential bid and promised to rally his supporters behind Mr Odinga.

He said his change of heart was as a result of wide consultation with his party leadership, the clergy and professionals.

Underscoring the role of Mr Moi in his final decision, he said: “To my brother Gideon Moi, you have redefined the meaning and essence of brotherhood. You’ve been with me in the best of moments and the darkest of hours. You’re a gentleman. Receive my heartfelt gratitude. As a people, our true measure lies in our ability to discern when the nation is bigger than an individual.”

He went on: “After deep introspection, I have today deferred my dreams to run for the President of the Republic of Kenya in the forthcoming General Election. As Abraham Lincoln once told a nation, ‘We are friends, not enemies; the passion may have strained but it must never break our bonds of affection’.”

“Therefore, after wide consultation with the party leadership, the clergy, the professionals, I’ve decided to accept with humility and appreciation my nomination as the Chief Minister in Azimio la Umoja One Kenya when, and not if, we form government.

The Wiper leader also used the occasion to congratulate Mr Odinga’s running mate.

“I would also wish to congratulate the Hon Martha Wangari Karua on her nomination as the Deputy President nominee of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party and I assure her of my unequivocal support,” Mr Musyoka said.

Mr Musyoka had announced his solo presidential run on May 16, the same day Mr Odinga nominated Ms Karua as his running mate.

The former vice-president was expected to appear before the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission tomorrow for registration as a presidential candidate, but this will now not happen.

Yesterday’s announcement follows resolutions by Wiper leaders from Ukambani region to have Mr Musyoka work with the Azimio team.

A section of professionals from the region had also disclosed that the interests of the community would only be catered for under Azimio and urged the Wiper leader to reconsider his candidature.

Yesterday, Mr Odinga paraded his troops, including Mr Musyoka’s lieutenants, saying, the Azimio team was now complete and ready for the elections.

“Kalonzo Musyoka is a friend and I’m glad by the sacrifice he has made to rejoin our team. His return together with Gideon Moi now fills our positions 10 and 11. The team is now complete and ready for the match,” Mr Odinga said.

He dared Deputy President William Ruto to a duel, promising a match like never before.

“This is a very unique team. It’s none of the usual teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal or even Manchester United, it’s a combination of all those teams,” he said, alluding to Azimio’s might.

Azimio Secretary General Junet Mohamed likened the team to a giant plane, full of passengers and now ready for take-off.

“The plane is now on the runway and passengers are advised to tighten their seatbelts ready for take-off,” Mr Mohamed said.

The Mukuru rally was also attended by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and her Makueni counterpart, Prof Kivutha Kibwana, who both pledged to work with Mr Musyoka, as well as Governors Hassan Joho (Mombasa).

Ms Anne Kananu (Nairobi), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna, his Kanu counterpart Nick Salat, Jubilee Vice-Chairman David Murathe and a host of other leaders and aspirants also attended the rally.

Mr Moi echoed Mr Odinga, saying, Mr Musyoka’s return was a guarantee of a first round win by Azimio in the August elections.

To win in the first round, a candidate has to garner 50 per cent plus one vote.

“We’re now sure of a round one win and there is absolutely no doubt about that. We thank Kalonzo Musyoka for making this happen,” Mr Moi said.

Mr Musyoka pledged his commitment to the coalition’s campaign activities going forward.

“I’m back to play position 11, I’m Messi, I was on the bench and now I’m back on the pitch and will pass the ball to Raila in position 9 to score the goal,” said Mr Musyoka, in reference to Argentine forward Lionel Messi, known for his swift passes and agility on the field.

Mr Musyoka’s proposed running mate before he dropped his bid, Mr Andrew Sunkuli, also pledged his loyalty to Mr Odinga and Azimio, promising to take part in the campaigns to deliver victory to Azimio.

Former Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi on December 15, 2017. He has authored a book titled ‘The Unending Surprises in Marriage.


By 
Keziah Waringa




In his latest book, The Unending Surprises in Marriage, Prof Jacob T. Kaimenyi makes a critical examination of the institution that is facing many challenges arising from modernity. People tie the knot for different reasons, making the institution complex; and not all reasons are so obvious at first glance. 

Some people get married so they can get citizenship, especially in the Western countries, to fit in and please age mates, parents and friends or simply to gain economic benefits by viewing marriage as a ticket to financial independence.

These are among many issues that the author expounds on. Despite examining the many facets and foundations of marriage, the author remains unequivocal in his argument; for him, the bottom line is that love should be the cause and reason for marriage.

“For marriage to last, you must make many sacrifices,” he writes in his fifth book, which he jointly launched with Move On at a ceremony presided over by Chief Justice Martha Koome.

He warns that the sacred institution should not be turned into a sport where each spouse keeps a scorecard.

Sharing wisdom gained from his own experiences and those of people in his circles, he postulates that as soon as the wedding is over, the newlyweds realise that marriage requires one to familiarise themselves with their spouse, learn to appreciate this new phase of life and adjust their behaviour and attitude accordingly. 

Such drastic changes may cause conflict at different times because all individuals are unique and no couples are alike in all ways. This may also be brought about when one sees marriage as the end goal of having a fulfilling relationship. Spouses, he says, should be ready to openly discuss and listen to each other and talk about issues affecting them in an amicable manner. 

He also cautions that individuals change due to circumstances and environment. As such, understanding that the goal of marriage is not to win a competition and take positions, but to unify the differences involved for a fulfilling and long-term relationship is important.

The cover of the book The Unending Surprises in Marriage, Prof Jacob Kaimenyi.

At first what meets the eye is what attracts one to the beholder, which is fair enough at the beginning of the relationship. Soon after, however, one encounters surprises from their spouse that they did not anticipate.

Citing examples, the author pin points the characteristics that greatly impact marriage both from a wife’s point of view and a husband’s as well. Just to mention a few, relating to others especially family and friends in a home and poor hygiene standard are not aspects of a wife a husband would note during courting. This characteristic can raise a lot of concern and conflict in marriage. 

Similarly, society has normalised men being the sole providers in a family. While this brings in income and resources for the family, it might affect the union adversely. It may lead to an unsupportive parenting partner, an abusive and controlling husband, one that believes that only his choices and preferences are right and only cares about his image in public. This is one of the issues that springs surprises in marriages if not well addressed. 

Sooner or later, the symbol of love and a blessing to the union is born. Having a child, the author says, may come with a number of surprises as well: From the wife not being able to balance the wifely and motherly duties to the husband being physically and emotionally unavailable for the children. 

However, having a life partner can bring forth positive surprises. And although challenges are bound to come by in life, having a committed partner who is reliable, acts as an assistant to your ventures and a prayer partner, makes a husband feel loved, cared for and even gets the strength to dream big and go for it.

The sense of security a husband brings to his wife and home, having a parenting partner, creating wealth for future generations and being the bread winner of the family in most cases, are some of the positive attributes of a husband that the author significantly writes on.

One would think that surprises in marriage are only between the wife and husband. Extensively, children, grandchildren, parents and in-laws, relatives and friends may bring up surprises that can significantly affect a marriage. Children and grandchildren may make parents question their marital choices.

Having different choices is normal but it may affect the marriage if the decision of either spouse leads to dire consequences. Children could also toss the advice of their parents and turn out hostile, ungrateful or engage with bad company.

Nonetheless, children bring a lot of joy, to their parents and grandparents. For instance, by supporting them during their old age, they solve problems based on current and modern solutions and most of all following in their parents’ footsteps, hence making them proud. 

The author further explains about situations where in-laws affect a marriage both positively and negatively. 

“Concerning in-laws, take advice from both sides, analyse it critically, and curate it to fit your cause,” the author says. 

Over ages there has been a common norm that in-laws are evil and wish nothing but the best for their child and not the spouse or anything associated with them. However, in-laws, especially the parents, can have a positive impact on a marriage. They are role models to a happy marriage, take care and instil discipline in their grandchildren, offer support during hard times and solve conflicts besides advising on various issues that a couple may face in marriage.

Marriage will bring forth a number of predicaments and the author argues that one should involve their spouse, resolve the issues at hand early enough and implement different strategies to resolve different matters. Where necessary, they can include helpful and understanding friends, religious leaders, legal experts and parents. Understanding and intentionally loving and supporting your partner is a key aspect in making sure the bond doesn’t break, the book says. 

It is not possible to exhaust the gems of advice dispensed in the book, which explains various aspects of surprises in marriage at length. That is why readers should get themselves a copy because each facet will speak differently to every reader depending on their marriage and life circumstances. 

What is important to mention is that this is an important book for married couples and those planning to get married. It is also written in the characteristic humorous and easy to grasp style that sets the envoy’s books apart. 

Prof Kaimenyi, a dentist by profession, is Kenya’s ambassador to the EU and a former Cabinet Secretary for Lands and Education. He has also served as Vice Chancellor at the University of Nairobi among other roles in his colorful career. 

His book is available in various bookstores and retails at Sh1,500 a copy. 

The reviewer is a student at KCA University.

148,News,"Visiting President of Sierra Leone Julius Maada Bio, inspects a guard of honour at State House, Nairobi on May 30, 2022. Equality Now and its partners in Kenya and Sierra Leone have appealed to him to legislate an anti-FGM law in Sierra Leone.


By 
Equality Now & Partners




Dear President Bio,

We, women’s rights actors living and working in Kenya, are pleased to welcome you to Kenya on this Madaraka Day.

This is not only for the reason that in 2020, Sierra Leone lifted the education ban ensuring all students, regardless of their status, can access school including pregnant girls, but also for the fact that Sierra Leone has signed and ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol).

In this regard, we feel that Sierra Leone and Kenya share a kindred bond, in committing to comprehensive legal frameworks that serve to both prevent the violation of women’s rights and also to respond, in the event that violations occur.

However, Mr President, we wish to offer that there is yet one more step your country can take to protect the rights of women and girls and be fully compliant with its Pan African, as well as global legal obligations. Sierra Leone needs a total ban of female genital mutilation (FGM).

You see Mr President, both the World Health Organization and the Centre for Disease Control have found that this harmful practice has completely no health benefits. On the contrary, it is known to be detrimental to the wellbeing of girls and women in innumerable ways.

Firstly, it is extremely painful and traumatic. Secondly, the unnecessary removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and causes several immediate and long-term health consequences, including fistula and even death.

Thirdly babies born to women who have undergone FGM suffer a higher rate of neonatal death compared to babies born to women who have not undergone the procedure.

In fact, the United Nations Committee against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in its General Comment number 2 of 2008, found that FGM amounts to torture.

Torture- including FGM as agreed by all nations across the world, is a human rights violation and illegal. Sierra Leone’s most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reports that nearly 90 per cent of women and girls in the country have been subjected to FGM. This year, there have also been reports of deaths as a result of FGM-related complications.

Mr President, whereas communities that practice FGM put up many reasons to justify its practice including religion and culture, a human rights perspective informs us that the practice has deep roots in inequality between the sexes; that it constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It violates the rights to health, security and physical integrity of the person, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death. It is only allowed to go on unfettered where communities fail to recognize women as human beings deserving of their rights including the right to life.

Mr President, Sierra Leone has already taken a first powerful step of ratifying the Maputo Protocol, whose Article 5 provides that FGM is illegal. We now implore you to take the second and most definitive step of legislating an anti-FGM law in Sierra Leone.

Kenya has the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act and the President has committed that ending FGM will be his legacy this year. Kenya’s efforts have borne fruit with UNFPA recording prevalence rates at 21 per cent down from 37.6 per cent in the previous years.

The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action in 1995, identified ending FGM as essential to realizing girls’ rights including the right to education, which we know to be dear to the Sierra Leonean government and people.

We hope that as you return back to Sierra Leone, you will take these successes for women and girls and make them a common point of action and commitment between these two great nations.

Sincerely,

Equality Now and its partners in Kenya and Sierra Leone.



Equality Now works across Africa towards a just world for women and girls.

147,News,"In this file photo taken on September 04, 2015 US actor Johnny Depp and his wife US actress Amber Heard arrive for screening of the movie ""Black Mass"" presented out of competition at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival at Venice Lido. A US jury on June 1, 2022 found Johnny Depp and Amber Heard defamed each other, but sided far more strongly with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star following an intense libel trial involving bitterly contested allegations of sexual violence and domestic abuse.


By 
AFP




A US jury Wednesday found both Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard liable for defamation -- but sided more strongly with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star following an intense trial riding on bitterly contested allegations of domestic abuse.

The verdict capped a bitterly-fought six-week trial riding on lurid claims and counterclaims of between the Hollywood celebrities.

The seven-member jury in Virginia awarded the 58-year-old actor $15 million in damages after finding that a 2018 article penned by Heard on her experience of ""sexual violence"" was defamatory to Depp.

Also Read: Men get abused, too. We need to talk about it

Heard, her eyes downcast throughout, listened impassively as the verdict was read out in Fairfax court, near the US capital -- and later declared herself ""heartbroken"" and disappointed ""beyond words"" by the outcome.

Depp, who was following the proceedings from the United Kingdom, meanwhile posted on Instagram that the jury ""gave me my life back.""

In the op-ed for The Washington Post, Heard had described herself as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"" -- and although she did not name Depp in the piece, he sued her for implying he was an abuser, seeking $50 million in damages.

The 36-year-old Heard, who had a starring role in ""Aquaman,"" countersued for $100 million, saying she was defamed by statements made by Depp's lawyer, Adam Waldman, who told the Daily Mail her abuse claims were a ""hoax.""

The jury agreed that Heard was defamed by those statements, and also awarded her damages -- but at a significantly lower amount, $2 million.

Reacting to the verdict, Heard called it a ""setback"" for women.

""The disappointment I feel today is beyond words. I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband,"" she said in a statement.

""I'm even more disappointed with what this verdict means for other women. It is a setback... It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously,"" she said.

A few dozen onlookers and Depp supporters were posted outside for the verdict, one man sporting a ""Jack Sparrow"" pirate hat and a woman with a placard reading: ""No matter what happens today, Johnny, you are a winner!!! And the whole word knows the TRUTH!!!""

Dozens of witnesses testified during the trial, including bodyguards, Hollywood executives, agents, entertainment industry experts, doctors, friends and relatives.

Depp and Heard each spent days on the witness stand during the televised trial, which was attended by hundreds of fans of the ""Pirates"" star and accompanied by a #JusticeForJohnnyDepp campaign on social media.

Video and audio recordings of heated, profanity-laced arguments between the couple were played for the jury, which was also shown photographs of injuries allegedly suffered by Heard during their volatile relationship.

Depp testified that it was Heard who was frequently violent and said it has been ""brutal"" to listen to ""outlandish"" accusations of domestic abuse made against him.

Heard, who was married to Depp from 2015 to 2017, obtained a restraining order against him in May 2016, citing domestic violence.

Depp, a three-time Oscar nominee, filed a libel suit in London against the British tabloid The Sun for calling him a ""wife-beater."" He lost that case in November 2020.

Both sides have claimed damage to their Hollywood careers.

By 
WENDY WATTA






One of the latest entrants into Nairobi’s food scene having opened in mid-December, thereabout, is Shokupan Japanese Bakery, located in Sarit Center, Westlands. I had a friend, an avid foodie, visiting from London having been away from Kenya for three years, and my goal was to curate the perfect experience for them to get a true taste for Kenya, and we therefore ended up checking out numerous restaurants around the country. 



Shokupan is actually an umbrella term for a Japanese-style bread, and the word loosely translates to “eating bread” in English. The restaurant (it’s more like a cafe, actually) at Sarit itself is not strictly Japanese, if the menu is anything to go by. They do have a very bold and vibrant pink cherry blossom tree smack in the middle of the restaurant, the perfect backdrop for a date, brunch with a friend and endless social media photos. For such a small space, the ambiance is very charming. 



At the bakery, which is a little removed from the indoor dining space, you can find items like four varieties of swiss rolls (they even have a matcha one which I’m dying to try next time), three varieties of croffles which are a hybrid of a croissant and a waffle, some tiramisu, milo mille crepe cake, strawberry shortcakes and more. 



The menu is generally vegetarian and the breakfast section averages Sh1,000. I was quite torn between the souffle pancakes (served with strawberries, butter and maple syrup…my mouth is watering just daydreaming about it, but I'm trying to slow down on the carbs) and the acai bowl, eventually settling on the latter. It was a thing of beauty, that acai bowl- a frozen coconut smoothie bowl loaded with berries, banana, chia seeds, coconut shavings and roasted nuts. There’s a time before the pandemic when Instagram was flooded with images of acai bowls so delightfully pretty you wondered how one could even bear to eat them, and I may have just found my new go-to spot in the city. My friend went for the avocado on toast which came served with scrambled tofu and sautéed asparagus. The plating at Shokupan is certainly enhanced by the elegant cutlery. 



You can also get soups, salads, sando, dumplings and mains which range from udon noodles and pad thai to teriyaki, for an average of Sh1200.

From menstrual cramps to ovarian cancer, there are a number of health concerns that women have to deal with on a regular basis. While some merely affect their daily activities, others are life-threatening.

However, thanks to health inventions, women have access to tools and technologies that can help them overcome these challenges.

Here are some of the incredible health inventions that have been developed specifically for women

Menstrual cups

The menstrual cup is a silicone cup inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood. It is worn for long hours and can be washed and reused. The menstrual cup is an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and convenient alternative to pads and tampons.

There are various sizes for menstrual cups depending on age, flow and whether the woman has given birth vaginally or not.

Consulting a gynaecologist will help you choose the perfect menstrual cup for you.

Pregnancy pillow

The pregnancy pillow is a large, U-shaped pillow designed to provide support to pregnant women. It can help with sleeping, sitting, and even breastfeeding.

The pregnancy pillow helps alleviate common problems such as back pain, neck pain, and stomach pain.

Breast pump

The breast pump is a device that helps extract milk from the breasts of lactating women. It can be used to store milk for later use or to feed a baby directly.

The breast pump is helpful for women who want to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. It is also beneficial for women who wish to increase their milk production.

The breast pump can be electric or manual. Consult a doctor before using a breast pump.

Post-natal girdle

The post-natal girdle is a garment that helps support the abdomen and improve posture after giving birth. As the name suggests, it is worn after giving birth. It has other benefits such as

Tampons are safe to use and have a number of benefits, such as

It is important to change tampons every four to eight hours.

Ovulation predictor kit

Ovulation predictor kit helps women predict when they are ovulating. It can help with fertility treatment or avoid pregnancy. The ovulation predictor kit tests the luteinizing hormone (LH) level in the urine.

The kit is easy to use and can be purchased from pharmacies or online stores.

With the increase of women struggling to conceive, the ovulation predictor kit has become essential for many couples.

Vaccines 

Vaccines are one of the most important inventions in medicine. They have helped save millions of lives by preventing deadly diseases.

The HPV vaccine protects against human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a virus that can cause cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine is given to girls aged nine to thirteen. Or women who have never had any form of sexual contact.

The HPV vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Therefore, it is important to receive the HPV vaccine at a young age.

Contraception methods

There are a number of contraception methods that are available for women. These include

The invention of these contraceptives has spearheaded a revolution in women's health.

Each woman has her unique needs and preferences, so it is important to find a contraceptive method that works best for you. Also, it is advisable to consult a doctor before choosing a contraception method.


Menorrhagia is frequent, heavy, menstrual bleeding that has an impact on a woman’s physical and emotional health. 


A miscarriage is a pregnancy that ends before 24 weeks, which is before most developing babies are able to survive outside the womb (uterus). 


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.

144,News,"It is important for men to be supportive and wait until their partner is ready for intimacy. 


By 
Simon Mburu




After childbirth, sex is probably the last thing on your partner’s mind. And for good reasons – she is physically exhausted and her emotions are unstable as she adjusts to the demands of new motherhood. The attention you used to get will also be taken by the baby.

In other words, it will take some time before your partner is ready for any intimate encounters.

Here is what you need to know about intimacy after childbirth

How long will it take to resume sex?

Time will vary depending on the type of delivery your partner had and how complicated or smooth it was. Dr. Janet Thuthwa, an obstetrician-gynecologist, recommends resuming sex after at least six weeks following a vaginal birth. This period applies to birth by cesarean section, subject to approval by your doctor.

“If she had an episiotomy, resuming sexual activity too soon will increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and uterine infection,” says Dr. Thuthwa.

An episiotomy is a surgical incision done to widen the vaginal canal during delivery.

After physical healing, it might take more time before a woman regains her pre-pregnancy libido because of hormonal imbalances caused by a drop in estrogen levels, nursing, pain around the genital area, and postpartum emotions.

“Estrogen is a sex hormone mainly made in the ovaries, and is responsible for regulation and development of the woman’s reproductive system and sex characteristics,” Dr. Thuthwa explains.

Chances are that your partner’s interest in sex will only start rising after weaning.

“When you are nursing, the decrease in estrogen together with high prolactin and oxytocin levels simulate menopause in the first two to three months,” says Dr. Rebecca Booth, a gynecologist and the author of The Venus Week.

The body changes

After delivery, your partner’s body will change. Some changes might be permanent. Dr. Yvonne Fulbright, the author of The Better Sex says that for a start, your partner’s breasts might grow permanently, and the abdominal stretch sustained from the nine-month gestation period might result in a permanent, slightly stretched belly. Your partner might put on weight that she may seem unable to get rid of. “If you don’t step in and reassure her, these physical changes will dent her confidence to embrace nakedness and intimacy,” Dr. Fulbright says.

According to Dr. Thuthwa, reproductive changes that could affect her attitude and desire for sex include episiotomy, vaginal dryness, soreness, pain, low libido, bleeding, loss of elasticity in vaginal tissue, and thin vaginal tissue.

Getting the groove back

Once you understand that she may not be in the mood, take initiative to show her that she is still desirable and worthy of a good treat. You can start by scheduling quality time together. Sarah Hunter, a sex therapist and the author of Not Always in the Mood says that you should get a qualified nanny who can stand in when you have your quality time. “Quality time doesn’t mean asking for intimacy. Hold hands, embrace each other, and sit on the couch,” she says. Arrange for dinner dates and make a habit of showing her romantic gestures until intimacy returns. Encourage her to go get spruced up at the hair salon or spa as you spend time with the baby. Occasionally bring her flowers and perform your fatherly and spousal duties of helping with the baby and doing chores around the house. 

Communication

How you communicate will play a role in how soon sex resumes, how it happens, and how often it occurs. “Don’t make assumptions. Just as you may assume that she doesn’t need you anymore, your lady might be thinking that you no longer find her attractive and desirable,” says Dr. Fulbright. Learn how to express your postpartum love language, and be gentle and sensitive in what you say. For example, when you first engage in intimacy postpartum, your partner will be very conscious and anxious about her body. Don’t make weird remarks or awkward jokes.




If your prostate gland including the seminal vesicles is removed during surgery, you will have dry orgasms during intercourse, according to the PCF journal.


Postpartum depression is characterised by problems bonding with the child, loss of appetite, insomnia, and high levels of irritability.

Joan Thuo, popularly known as Joan the Career Coach, branched out of her human resource job after sitting in many panels as an interviewer and realising how candidates struggle in the interview sessions. Having started this career in 2019, she shares critical insights on interview preparation and career coaching.

How did the business idea come about?

After revamping my sister’s curriculum vitae (CV), LinkedIn profile and creating a cover letter that made her get a better job with good pay,  I saw a niche in the market. Coupled with witnessing so many interviewees struggle with presenting themselves and their documents during job interviews, I branched out from corporate to entrepreneurship.

What does the business entail?

In a nutshell we try to significantly increase the chances of an interviewee to get a job. This is through revamping CVs, creating and refurbishing LinkedIn profiles and cover letters, preparing candidates for interview sessions and holding career coaching lessons.

So how long does it take for a recruiter to read through a candidate’s CV?

A recruiter has at most six seconds to go through your CV before they decide whether they will continue reading. This being the case, one’s documentshould be as close to perfection as possible in terms of formatting, no spelling mistakes and not exceeding two pages.

What should an applicant’s CV be like?

It should be tailored according to the organisation’s requirements. For a modern resume, ensure it is appealing to the eyes of the recipient in terms of colors used, infographics and photo of the applicant.

For large organisations and multinational corporations, the document should be plain and compliant to the applicant tracking system (Ats). This is because the resume is vetted by a software before landing at the interviewer. For a video CV, a candidate should describe what is in there in under five minutes.

What of the applicant’s social media pages?

The most important social media handle an applicant should ensure its crisp is their LinkedIn. The profiles should have a professional look from having a professional photo, to the headline which accentuates their job titles.

They can use an application called Canva to create a good cover photo. Thanks to the availability of space, applicants should ensure that the content in their bio is very rich and well detailed.

What do applicants miss when applying for jobs?

So many applicants have only one CV which they send to different organisations. This copy, most of the time, is not tailored to the different job descriptions the applicant is seeking to apply, hence reducing their chances of securing the job.

Secondly, people freelance when going for an interview and do not adequately prepare for both physical and online interviews. This is paired by the applicant not doing research on the organisation, hence lacking questions to the panelist when called upon.

Interestingly, some interviewees pose ‘awkward’ questions like ‘which internet providers do you use?’ ‘do you offer lunch?’ ‘is there a boot camp?’ Such questions are not pertinent to the job description and tend to show lack of seriousness.

What does an interviewee need to do in case of an online interview? For an online interview, a candidate should ensure that their devices are fully charged and that there is stable internet connection.

Additionally, they should ensure that their background and environment is plain and quiet. Login 20 minutes before the interview, put on a smile and be smartly dressed. An online interview is as rigorous as a physical one and the basic nitty gritty are always adhered to.

Which salary range should one give?

The quotation a candidate gives should mirror research on how much one gets paid for the role. This quotation should be a higher salary but one that gives room for negotiation.

What should one do on the day of the interview?

A candidate should be punctual. They should be formally dressed with ladies’ ensuring their make-up is simple. Be composed and be precise in your responses.

When should career coaching begin?

Coaching begins when a child is young. Identifying their strengths and capabilities spearheads what the child is passionate about and helps them make informed decisions when they need to select courses in the technical colleges and universities.

However, career coaching is a continuous process and studying the trends that are currently available in a job market helps one foresee whether the future will sustain their careers or not.

142,News,"Natural remedies such as lavender essential oils and magnesium supplements may help you sleep.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Stress is the number one cause of insomnia. Stress triggers can be as simple as an inability to sleep or anxiety about a job interview. However, insomnia can also be caused by more severe problems such as mental health issues and chronic pain.

The good news is that there are many ways to manage insomnia such as the use of over-the-counter medication and natural remedies like lavender essential oils. In addition, people use supplements and herbal teas to lower levels of stress hormones, which often cause difficulty sleeping.

Insomnia is the inability to fall asleep. Think of insomnia as an onion with many layers. The outermost layer of the onion may be stress caused by a job interview or mental health problems.

The next layer may be pain or other chronic illnesses. Then you have other factors like medication side effects and alcohol use.

There may also be times when you stay up late either because of work, travel, or studies; these can interfere with your sleep cycle.

Types of insomnia:

Chronic insomnia – chronic means long-term and lasts for three months or longer. This type of insomnia is usually related to an ongoing issue, such as chronic pain or mental health problems.

Short-term insomnia – if you have trouble sleeping one night or less than a week and then it goes away, this is called transient. It is usually caused by a change in the weather or taking on too much work at home or school.

Acute insomnia – if insomnia persists for a month, then ends.

Major symptoms of insomnia

Daytime mental and physical fatigue – this is a usual symptom of insomnia. It can cause problems with memory, concentration, or job performance.

You may feel irritable because you do not have the energy to do things. This can lead to relationship difficulties at home or work, especially if your tiredness causes you to snap at loved ones or co-workers.

Insomnia can cause anxiety, tension, and depression. All of these are common symptoms of insomnia because it affects your mental health.

If you have chronic pain, the inability to sleep will make the pain worse. Find a way that works for you so that your quality of life is not affected.

Insomnia treatment

Behavioural treatments are recommended as the first line of defense against sleep disorders. Behavioural techniques can retrain normal sleeping behaviour disrupted by stress and anxiety.

The behavioural process involves creating a personalised plan. Therefore, you will know precisely what actions need changing prior to bedtime. This includes ensuring you do not use your computer a few hours before bedtime, taking a warm bath before sleep, and other actions that promote good sleep hygiene.

Behavioural therapies for insomnia teach your body to link going into bed with sleeping rather than being awake.

Natural remedies such as lavender essential oils and magnesium supplements may help you sleep. Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxant, and lavender oil has been shown to reduce cortisol levels in the body, which can improve your ability to fall asleep.

Medical treatments –  In cases where behavioural therapy does not work, doctors may suggest taking over-the-counter medication to help you fall asleep. But this will only be for the short-term and must always be used under your doctor's direction.

Whether you are struggling to fall asleep, waking up in the night, or experiencing early morning wakeups that affect your body function during your day, insomnia can have a significant impact on your quality of life.

No matter what is preventing you from getting a good shut-eye at night, you can get help.  Ready to take control? Act today

Faith Ngele who is serving a one-year sentence at the Wundanyi Women Prison in Taita Taveta County, vows to improve her economic status once she completes her term next year.

Through a partnership programme with Nafisika Trust and some members of the local community, she has earned a certificate in various skills that will enable her start businesses at home.

Ms Ngele, who has completed a training at the facility, now looks forward to her release so that she can set up a salon or a soap making business.

""I would not have gotten such training if I was out there. So, sometimes I don't regret coming to prison,"" she said.

She is among 25 female inmates who graduated after completing a Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) programme initiated by the Prison Service last February.

""I now have a job lined up for me after my release next year. I do not worry about where to start upon my arrival at home,"" she said.

She noted that she now uses her time in prison to better her life and does not view her jail term as an obstacle, but rather an opportunity to think of possible solutions for her future.

The inmates acquired entrepreneurial and life skills in tailoring, event planning, hairdressing, knitting, detergent and bleach making, baking, pastry and catering among others.

They also learnt various aspects of running a home-based business that will help them earn an income, while caring for their children, to minimise stigma from the communities they come from.

For two months, they have acquired business and entrepreneurship training as well as soft skills such as setting goals and taking care of themselves from the Nafisika Trust organisation. Through the Imarika and Make a Change programme, they were also trained in marketing.

Officer in-charge at Wundanyi Prison Jostinah Mwang'ombe, speaks during the graduation ceremony at the facility.



Wundanyi Prison Officer in Charge Jostinah Mwang'ombe, said the training was part of rehabilitation programmes lined up for the inmates by the State Department for Correctional Services that seeks to reform prisoners for social re-integration.

She disclosed that it was also meant to change society’s perception of prisons.

""One thing that cuts across those that are brought here is lack of economic empowerment. We decided to give them skills and knowledge to help them resettle once they come out,"" she said.

Ms Mwang'ombe added that the correctional facilities are not punitive centres for criminals, but rather a place to reform, rehabilitate, as well as make them good citizens.

""It is, therefore, our responsibility to rehabilitate the inmates as they serve their sentence. The skills aim to equip them to be able to run the business once they are released from prison so that they don't become a burden to society or go back to crime,"" she said.

She noted that the three-month programme also focused on improved service delivery at the facility, revamping the prison enterprises, enhancing the wellness of inmates and staff, and strengthening collaboration with partners and stakeholders.

“We managed to finish the programme in two months because we had a very dedicated team,” she said.

An ex-prisoner, Mariam Mwikali, said she is set to use her skills to start a business in her home in Taveta.

Following her release last month, she said life has not been easy as she has faced stigma in the village, but hopes to start her enterprise to minimise the discrimination.

""I don't prefer getting employed because I went to jail because of someone's business. Once I get capital, I will start my own business,"" she said.

Nafisika Trust has worked with the State Department of Correctional Services in various prisons across the country for 13 years.

The chief executive officer Rose Thuku, said they will support some inmates to start their businesses once they come out of prison.

""We aim to empower the inmates, for them to understand the market trends so that they can sell their products. The skill-building is to fully equip them all round for the life ahead,"" she said.

Nine officers have also graduated from the programme, which also involves volunteers, donors and business advisers from the local community.

A psychologist from the Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi Brenda Wanga, offered counselling services to the inmates and the officers.

“We help the inmates to see that their past mistakes do not have to define their future. We prepare them to face the community once they finish their sentences,” she said.

140,News,"Infertility in men is a common challenge in relationships


By 
Simon Mburu




After marriage, relatives and neighbours usually begin to count days until a baby arrives. The expectation is that a baby will follow soon after a couple gets married. The reality is that sometimes the baby takes a long to come or does not come at all.

The blame of delayed childbirth or childlessness in a marriage is usually seen as the fault of the woman. The reality is that male infertility is a big factor in childlessness.



What statistics say

Infertility is on the rise in Kenya. According to data from the Kenya Fertility Society, at least one in every five couples suffers from infertility. The data also estimates that at least 4.2 million Kenyans require medical assistance to conceive.

The most common reproductive problems are low sperm count, zero sperm count, and blocked tubes. The World Health Organization attributes 20 percent of infertility cases to men and 27 percent to both men and women. The Kenya Fertility Society attributes up to 30 percent of infertility cases to men, 30 percent to women, and 40 percent to unknown factors. 

Impotence vs infertility

 Impotence also referred to as erectile dysfunction, is the inability of a man to get and maintain an erection. On the other hand, infertility also referred to as sterility, refers to the inability of a man to make and release sperm. With impotence, sexual intercourse is impossible but with infertility, sex is possible but conception is impossible.

Let's look at the causes of impotence

Psychological impotence

Psychological impotence is a condition in which a man is unable to get an erection, struggles to get an erection, or has difficulties maintaining an erection due to psychological triggers. Dr. Gitobu Mburugu, a Consultant Urologist at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), and chair of the Kenya Association of Urological Surgeons says that this form of impotence is on the rise among younger men who’d otherwise not have erectile problems or impotence. “We are witnessing an increase in the number of sexually traumatised young men with psychological impotence due to pressure and performance expectations perpetrated by society and contained in pornographic materials,” he says.



Medical impotence

Endocrine diseases such as diabetes can lead to medical impotence. An endocrine disorder affects the endocrine system which produces hormones that regulate among others reproduction, mood, sexual function, and metabolism. Conditions such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of impotence. According to Dr. Alana Biggers, an internal medicine physician, chronic disease epidemiologist, and author of The Chronicles of Women in White Coats, if you have diabetes, the risk of impotence comes from nerve damage which affects your penile sensations, impaired blood flow, and hormone levels. “There are neurological conditions such as brain tumor, stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s diseases which may affect your ability to stay fertile. Medications, surgical procedures, and the use of drugs such as cimetidine used for cancer chemotherapy and prostate surgical procedures may induce impotence. ,” she says.

Lifestyle impotence

Lifestyle habits such as excessive drinking, smoking, a poor diet, obesity, and living a sedentary lifestyle can make it difficult for a man to have or maintain an erection. For instance, a research study by the United Kingdom’s Centre for Biotechnology Information found that the intensity of cigarette smoking is directly linked to the degree and severity of impotence in men.

Infertility

Causes of impotence are closely related to causes of infertility. Diabetes and cancer treatment through the use of chemotherapy and radiation are two of the commonly shared causes. Dr. Biggers says that injuries and infections to the testicles and the abuse of certain drugs such as steroids, sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, and genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis can result in infertility, “There is also a condition known as retrograde ejaculation in which the sperm flows into the bladder, [translating to infertility],” she says.



Coping

If you and your spouse have been unsuccessfully trying for a baby, you are both advised to go for a checkup. Dr. Mburugu says that you should not make assumptions or go for over-the-counter pills without a prescription. “The best way to treat erectile dysfunction or infertility is to go for medical diagnosis and treatment, not to buy sex-enhancing drugs,” he says. The effectiveness of the treatment will depend on how psychologically and physically healthy one is. This means that you need to eat a healthy diet, exercise, quit smoking, and excessive drinking. “Embrace intimacy. Cuddle and hold hands, communicate your feelings and fears to your partner openly and gently. Stay optimistic that you will get your groove back. Go out on spontaneous dinner dates, and start to explore sensuality in place of sexuality,” says psychologist Ken Munyua. 




Vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities.


If your prostate gland including the seminal vesicles is removed during surgery, you will have dry orgasms during intercourse, according to the PCF journal.


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.

139,News,"A child with stuttering problem visiting speech-language therapist at clinic.



Communication is the sharing of information from the sender to the receiver. It’s inevitable in our daily life experience. We communicate through various ways, including speech, eye contact, body movement and silence.

Communication deficits affect our social interactions with family, friends and employability. Friends and family of people with speech disorders tend to avoid lengthy conversation via phone call or face-to-face communication because of the amount of time it takes before complete communication has taken place. Most people prefer SMS, emails or written presentations.

May is known as the Better Hearing and Speech Month. It is a month meant for creating awareness on communication disorders. It covers any disorder that affects hearing, language and speech. It’s also meant for taking action for people with speech problems such as stuttering by identifying them, bringing them together and providing speech therapy.

Myths and misconceptions about persons with speech problems abound. Many people assume that persons who stutter or stammer are not smart, are slow learners or are inefficient in their places of work. Children who stammer experience ridicule and are denied opportunity to vie for leadership or to participate in class presentations.

 Employers also discriminate against persons with speech disorders in hiring and assigning tasks and promotions. In relationships, when selecting partners, those who stammer are looked down upon because they’re seen as an embarrassment and a burden.

It’s time we stopped stigmatising people with speech problems. Stakeholders should be involved in raising awareness to cure the ignorance and stigma around hearing and speech disorders.

Charity begins at home, so parents and teachers should be the first to stand up against this form of discrimination. They should show more love and appreciation of effort.  They should also facilitate free interaction with other children and adults.  Parents, teachers and healthcare providers should also make therapy more accessible.

Communication firms should adopt technologies that help these groups of people to communicate. Technology has made big strides in helping people with speech problems, for example speech assisted texting, but more needs to be done.

Technology gurus should come up with innovations that assist such persons lead a normal communication life. The government should spearhead awareness campaigns countrywide and also make therapy more available to those who need it.

Record Football Kenya Federation Premier League champions Gor Mahia on Wednesday clinched the Madaraka Day Cup after beating perennial rivals AFC Leopards 6-5 on post match penalties in an exhibition match at Nyayo National Stadium.

The win saw Gor Mahia walk home with Sh1 million and a trophy, while AFC Leopards also got a trophy and Sh500,000 from the state who were the organisers of the match.

The two teams had settled for a 1-1 draw in regular time. The win saw Gor Mahia continue their dominance over their arch-rivals both in the league and friendly matches for the past six years. The last time Leopards beat Gor Mahia was in 2016.

Ingwe defender Collins Shivachi replicated his impressive form in the league by giving Leopards the lead in the 35th minute via a glancing header.

Austin Odhiambo netted against his former side in the 67th minute to restore parity for Gor forcing the game to be decided on penalty shoot out.

Philemon Otieno, Samuel Onyango, Benson Omala, Dennis Ng'ang'a, John Macharia and Austin Odhiambo were successful for K'Ogalo in the penalties, while Tedian Esilaba, Washington Munene, Victor Omune, Josephat Lopaga, John Makwatta netted for Ingwe.

Leopards winger Peter Thiong'o sent his penalty sky-high.

Sports CS Amina Mohamed, who represented President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kanu Secretary General Nick Salat, who represented Azimio presidential aspirant Raila Odinga, gave out the awards to the two teams.

Both teams showed hunger for early goals on the onset, but most of the attempts ended up in the waiting hands of Gor Mahia goalkeeper Gad Mathews and Leopards custodian Levis Opiyo.

Gor Mahia teenage striker Benson Omala's bullet header from Peter Lwasa's cross in the eighth minute missed the target narrowly as K'Ogalo pushed for an early goal.

Gor threatened again at the quarter hour mark as Lwasa's free kick hit the wall before his rebound shot flew inches wide.

With just the ball to tap home in a one-on-one situation with Mathews, the 26-year-old blasted the ball wide.

A minute later, Omala beat Peter Thiong'o on the left to pick out Samuel Onyango. The forward unleashed a ferocious shot which was punched back to the field of play by Opiyo, but Lwasa's rebound shot was deflected by Tedi Esilaba for a corner.

In the 65th minute, Leopards won a free kick after Peter Lwasa fouled Kenyan international Cliff Nyakeya outside the danger zone.

Shivachi's glancing header from the free kick found the back of the net to give Ingwe the lead.

Belgium coach Patrick Aussems withdrew Olaniyi for Mark Makwatta in the 58th minute, while German tactician Andrea Spier made a double substitution with Lwasa and George Odhiambo paving way for John Macharia and Congolese forward Sando Sando Yangayay.

In the 67th minute, Opiyo gifted Gor Mahia an easy goal after he dangled with the ball inside the box and was dispossessed by Yangayay, who picked out Austin Odhiambo who slotted the ball home from a close range shot.

Despite late attacks from both sides, the scoreline did not change

137,News,"Gambling addiction can be related to other addictions, such as alcoholism.


By 
Fiona Muthoni


Gambling problems do not just affect one person, they often involve family members who have had their lives disrupted by an addict’s behaviour.



Gambling addiction affects many people. The more you gamble, the stronger your addiction becomes, and the harder it is to break free.

Here are some reasons people become addicted to gambling:

If you gamble in secret, it’s possible that your gambling is out of control and has become an addiction.

Particularly problematic behaviour includes:

One of the reasons people develop gambling addiction is because it is an easy way to escape from negative emotions. Gambling gives these people a sense of hope and excitement, even if only temporary. But they will lose all their money in the process and become depressed as a result.

In an interview with Aunt Truphena, a counseling psychologist, she said that gambling could cause anxiety, panic attacks, and to some extent, hallucinations.

She further advised that gamblers should be helped and not rejected. In other words, encourage the addict to seek help.

Rehabilitation

Treatment for a gambling addiction will depend on the severity of your problem.

The treatment options include group therapy, individual counselling, and residential rehabilitation, where you can get enough rest away from any temptations that may trigger a relapse.

Note that relapse is part of the recovery process and that it is not a sign of failure.

Talk to your doctor about the best plan for you before starting treatment because there may be other co-occurring conditions such as depression or anxiety disorders.

Behaviour change

You do not have to give up enjoyable things to stop gambling, but it is advisable to avoid anything that could make the problem worse.

You can also use meditation, yoga, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as effective treatments for depression caused by gambling addictions.


Treatment for sex addiction usually involves multiple therapeutic approaches.


Your words must acknowledge your spouse’s feelings and show compassion.

136,News,"Liverpool's supporters cheer as Liverpool's open-top bus parades through the streets of Liverpool in north-west England on May 29, 2022, to celebrate winning the 2021-22 League Cup and FA Cup. Despite the disappointment of losing to real Madrid in the final of the UEAF Champions League, Klopp has called on Liverpool fans to take to the streets of the city on Sunday when they parade the League Cup and FA Cup. 


By 
AFP




Uefa and the French football federation estimate that 2,800 'fake tickets' were scanned at the Champions League final, a source said Tuesday.

The two bodies gave that estimation at a crisis meeting on Monday at the French sports ministry, the source said.

That meeting was convened to examine what was behind the chaotic scenes that marred Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris, the Spanish side running out 1-0 winners.

The French government, which has faced a barrage of criticism over policing of the match which saw thousands of Liverpool fans with tickets struggle to enter the Stade de France, has blamed ""massive"" ticket fraud for the disturbances.

French security services had warned authorities of the risk of 50,000 fans without tickets or with fake ones two days before the final, according to a document seen by AFP Tuesday.

A note from the National Division of the Fight against Hooliganism (DNLH) on May 25 -- written with the input of intelligence services and seen by AFP -- warned of ""around 50,000 English fans in the French capital who will not have tickets"".

""Some of them will have fake tickets and will try to use them to access the stadium,"" said the note from the DNLH, a branch of the police, although it does not estimate how many.

""Others will try to enter the arena by deception, for example by using the uniforms of stewards, UEFA, cleaning or medical staff,"" added the note that was largely distributed to the police.

After the crisis meeting at the sports ministry on Monday, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the root cause of the problems was ""massive, industrial-scale and organised fraud in fake tickets"".

Darmanin added there had been 30,000 to 40,000 Liverpool fans with fake tickets or without tickets outside the Stade de France.

Earlier on Monday Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera blamed Liverpool for leaving its supporters ""on the loose"", prompting the chairman of Liverpool Football Club to pen an angry letter demanding an apology for the ""irresponsible, unprofessional, and wholly disrespectful"" comments.

Some 22,000 tickets were officially allocated each to Real Madrid and Liverpool fans. A criminal investigation into the fake tickets has been launched in France.

The note also warned that ""several hundred English fans will try to enter the stadium by forcing the turnstiles and the various access doors"" and called for ""the greatest vigilance"" at the various checkpoints.

""If this event does not present particular risks in connection with violent supporters, disturbances to public order are to be feared, in particular due to the very large influx of supporters coming from all over Europe"", the note said.

Saturday's scenes tarnished the image of the French capital, raising questions about its ability to host major sporting events as it gears up for the 2024 Olympics, as well as the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

UEFA, European football's governing body, announced Monday it was opening an ""independent report"" into the problems at the final that would ""examine decision making, responsibility and behaviours of all entities involved"".

Two-time Olympic 1,500 metres champion Faith Chepng’etich will on Monday compete in the 800m race at the FBK Games in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

She will battle it out with the world champion over the distance, Ugandan Halima Nakayi.

Chepng’etich said that she will be using the race to improve her speed in preparation for the World Athletics Championships that will be held in Eugene, Oregon, United States of America on July 15-24.

The world 1,500m silver medallist finished second behind Burundi’s Francine Niyonsoba in the 3,000m race at the Doha Diamond League on May 13.

And at the Prefontaine Classic Diamond League held on Saturday in Eugene, Oregon, Chepng’etich ran a world-lead time of three minutes, 52.59 seconds (3:52.59) to win the 1,500m race.

“Competing in the 800m race is part of my training. I will be testing my speed as I prepare for the world championships in July. Speed is critical for a podium finish,” she told Nation Sport.

Chepng’etich will be looking to reclaim the world 1,500m title that she won during the 2017 edition held in London, but which she surrendered to Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands in Doha in 2019.

During the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games that were held last year, Chepng’etich defended her 1,500m title that she had previously won at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

In the 3,000m steeplechase, another top Kenyan athlete, Celliphine Chespol, will be seeking to qualify for the world championships.

The 2018 World Athletics Under-20 Championships winner in Tampere, Finland will be competing against Olympic champion Peruth Chemutai from Uganda, who will be participating in her fifth event this year.

During last week’s Prefontaine Classic, Eugene Diamond League, Chespol finished fifth in her specialty.

Kenyan-born Kazakhstani athlete Norah Jeruto won the race and another Kenyan-born Bahraini runner Winfred Yavi was second.

Chespol said that her season has started slowly, but she is getting back into shape. She said that the races she has participated in have helped her improve her performance.

“It has been a journey for me, but I’m happy that my training has been good. I have registered mixed results. I am looking forward to joining the national team for the World Athletics Championships and the Commonwealth Games,” said Chespol, who has held the junior record for five years since 2017 when she clocked 8:58.78.

The event will also see Ethiopian athletes compete in the 10,000m where a national team is expected to be selected for the July World Athletics Championships.

134,News,"Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook speaks during a panel discussion at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting on September 24, 2013 in New York City. 


By 
AFP




Meta's second most powerful executive Sheryl Sandberg made the shock announcement Wednesday she will leave after a 14-year tenure that included helping steer scandal-prone Facebook to advertising dominance.

Sandberg, 52, has been one of the most influential women in Silicon Valley and her departure comes as the social media juggernaut faces an uncertain future and fierce competition.

Her exit from Facebook parent Meta will be effective in the fall, she wrote on the platform, adding she planned to remain on the firm's board.

A Harvard-educated executive, Sandberg joined Facebook in 2008 when it was still just a startup, playing a formative role in its development into a multi-billion dollar advertising empire.

""Fourteen years later, it is time for me to write the next chapter of my life,"" Sandberg said. ""I am not entirely sure what the future will bring -- I have learned no one ever is.""

Her job made her not just a recognizable face in tech but also a household name, particularly thanks to her 2013 book ""Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.""

The best seller encouraged women to ""lean in"" to their careers in order to reach their full potential and overcome workforce obstacles.

It has drawn applause from admirers for articulating a new modern feminist vision and sharp criticism from detractors who say her lofty position has made her out-of-touch with the grueling personal cost of combining career and family.

The social network has recently rebranded itself in a pivot toward a belief the internet is headed towards becoming an immersive virtual world, referred to as the metaverse.

The Silicon Valley colossus has seen its image tainted by accusations it has put profit over user privacy and even the good of society.

""Sandberg leaves Meta, and the social media environment that Facebook helped create, in a far worse place than she found it,"" said Media Matters for America president Angelo Carusone.

""Hers is a legacy of enabling trolling, harassment, and abuse.""

Meanwhile, the likes of TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter and even Apple now vie with Meta for people's online attention as the Facebook platform is increasingly seen as a place for older people.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the role Sandberg held at the company will be re-shaped, with Javier Olivan becoming Meta's chief operating officer

The next COO will be more traditional, different from the close second-in-command status Sandberg holds, Zuckerberg said.

""She has taught me so much and she has been there for many of the important moments in my life, both personally and professionally,"" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.

""I'm going to miss running this company with Sheryl.""

Meta shares fell more than two percent on word that Sandberg was leaving, another blow to a stock value that has plummeted on worries that the company's regular growth was coming to an end.

Facebook was about four years old when Sandberg came on board as a mature, guiding hand at a tech firm with a motto ""move fast and break things.""

""I was only 23 years old and I barely knew anything about running a company,"" Zuckerberg said.

""Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company.""

Zuckerberg's farewell to Sandberg gave Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi a sense that he believes he has outgrown her

""It feels like that relationship is no longer needed or working,"" Milanesi told AFP

Sandberg, long seen as the ""adult"" at the youthfully managed firm, has found herself the center of controversy over her role in pushing back at criticism of the social media giant.

Sandberg drew fire in particular over an embarrassing effort to probe George Soros, the billionaire investor, after he assailed the online network as a ""menace to society.""

Facebook has acknowledged that Sandberg asked her staff to conduct research on the Hungarian-born billionaire following his remarks, out of concern that he held a ""short"" position that would profit from a decline in shares.

Among the tech whiz kids, Sandberg offered a steadier hand as a result of her background working for former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the philanthropic arm of Google.

Sandberg in 2015 was devastated by the sudden death of her husband, US tech executive David Goldberg, at an upscale resort in Mexico.

Two years ago she announced her engagement to marketing executive Tom Bernthal.

Wangu Kanuri




Everton midfielder Tyler Onyango is holidaying in Mombasa.

The footballer, who made his breakthrough in the just ended 2021/22 English Premier League season, posted photos showing him relaxing on the beach at the Kenyan Coastal city on his Instagram page.

Onyango, born in England to a Kenyan father and English mother, joined Everton aged eight and signed his first professional contract in July 2020, penning a three-year deal with the club.

Having consistently shone for Everton’s Under-18 team, Onyango was promoted to the Blues’ Under-23-set-up during the 2019/20 campaign.

Additionally, the 19-year-old played in seven Premier League 2 matches before the season was ended early due to the coronavirus pandemic.

He made his senior debut for the club on November 21 last year, in Everton's 3-0 loss to Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in the league.

Onyango turned down a chance to play for Kenya during the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifiers despite being handed a call up by then coach Engin Firat.

Mombasa, Kenya’s second-largest city located along the coast is one of the world’s preferred tourist destinations with millions of visitors streaming in from all over the world.

Onyango’s visit comes barely a month after African football legend Samuel Eto’o toured Malindi with his family.

Eto’o, a former Barcelona, Chelsea and Inter Milan forward, confirmed the news on his social media pages after posting a picture with his family.

132,News,"Kenya’s digital economy is expected to generate 9.24 percent of her total GDP by 2025.


By 
Albert Mwazighe


Reporter

In a few years to come, there won’t be enough skills to fill job positions created by Kenya’s growing start-up and innovation ecosystem unless government and academia boost efforts to develop these skills.

According to a study by Huawei Kenya, UNESCO and the Africa Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS), by the year 2030, 50-55 percent of jobs in Kenya will depend on digital skills, attributed to the adoption of 5G networks, cloud technologies and data centers by SMEs.

These are expected to create new opportunities which will require more ICT personnel. New opportunities lie mainly in security, data analysis and processing, cloud computing, IoT and connected devices, and value addition through the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Read: Let’s practise digital discipline to escape internet addiction 

“The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the digital economy to the country's development and increased the urgency of creating more and better jobs for Kenyan youth. However, as the economy evolves, the skills needed to take advantage of the changes and drive change are also changing. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that we nurture and influence the entire ecosystem to build the skills required to take advantage of the digital economy,” noted Huawei Kenya CEO Will Meng.

According to Mr Meng, Kenya’s reliance on ICT is expected to be much higher than most African countries. While Africa expects the digital economy to contribute about 5.2 percent of its GDP by 2025, Kenya’s digital economy is expected to generate 9.24 percent of her total GDP by 2025. Therefore, interventions that can contribute to further strengthening the digital economy will be desirable. One such intervention is talent cultivation.

“The ICT sector has been amongst the fastest growing in the country and will continue to be so for years to come. We must be ready for this growth by creating the workforce necessary to meet future needs and current needs. These call for concerted efforts, both at national and industry levels, for digital talent cultivation in Kenya to address the gap between the existing ICT knowledge and skills and the projected demand by the industry to help drive and sustain the digital economy,” noted Meng.

Though Kenya ranks highly in ICT skills development in Africa (top 3 or 5 in Africa in most indexes), it is much lower in the global context. The country ranks 70 out of 79 countries by Huawei Global Connectivity Index, 84 out of 134 countries by Network Readiness Index and 105 out 158 countries by UNCTAD’s 2021 readiness for frontier technology index.

This can be attributed to factors such as weak academia-industry collaboration that are inhibiting ICT skills development. Universities are offering curricula and teaching practices that are not adequately aligned with the needs of the job market. With rapidly evolving ICT technologies and the slow curricula review processes, most universities are constrained to catch up with expanding demand for IT skills on emerging technologies.

“The level of university-industry collaboration is rated low due to several barriers, including the absence of policies for incentivising partnership efforts in the universities, and lack of institutional and national support structures to coordinate establishment of such partnerships,” notes the report.

The report further notes that there is a need for more funding and opportunities for industrial attachment and internships, especially at TVET level. There are few undergraduate internship opportunities and most students have to find their own industrial attachments and internships with only 5 percent helped by their respective departments. There is also scarcity of industrial attachment opportunities offered by the private sector.

“If we don’t act now, Kenya and Africa will remain in the abyss of an unattractive labour force that cannot satisfy the modern labour market,” noted Principal Secretary for State Department for Vocational and Technical Training, Ministry of Education Dr Margaret Wawuda Mwakima.

The study highlights that there is a growing, but still low number of ICT graduates at intermediate and advanced ICT skills level with total estimated at less than 5,000 ICT students graduating per year.

The study recommends increasing this figure by supporting girls and women to get into ICT careers as they only make up around a third of current ICT students due to many barriers.

131,News,"Depression can have severe effects on relationships.


By 
Simon Mburu




On June 12, 2021, the lifeless body of Dr. Lydia Wahura was found in the back seat of her vehicle at the University of Nairobi. The 35-year-old, paediatrician at Kenyatta National Hospital died by suicide. Detectives who visited the scene found three syringes, a suicide note, and drugs in the car. “She had injected a syringe on her left arm. There were vials of Ketamine and Midazolam drugs at the back seat which she may have used,” detectives said.

Dr Wahura’s case became one of the latest in the rising statistics of fatal depression which knows no class, race, career, or gender.

What can you do when the person you are dating suffers from depression?

The warning signs

Low to zero interest in sex. Shannon Kolakowski, the author of When Depression Hurts Your Relationship says that 75 percent of people who are depressed lack the desire to engage in intimacy for lengthy periods.  “Low sex drive will manifest in a variety of ways including poor body image, resentment, shame about sex, performance anxiety or even medications,” she says. If your partner suddenly starts acting out, this could be a depression red flag too. “It is highly likely that she will act out her depression by getting into affairs, becoming aggressive over small issues, and shutting out friends, relatives, and even you,” she says.

Balancing needs

Psychotherapist Caitlin Cantor says that when dating someone with depression, create a balance in the way needs are met in the relationship. “Find a way to maintain a balance in the way you meet her needs, your needs, and the needs of the relationship,” she says. This means that while you will likely prioritise your partner’s needs over your own or the relationship’s, you must take care not to prolong this. “Depression may not be an illness that will go away quickly and you must learn how to put yourself first while still being supportive of your partner and the relationship,” she says.

Conflicting views

One of the ripple effects of depression in relationships is that it will put your perceptions of each other at crossroads. “If he is depressed, he may start to think and believe, ‘She doesn’t really care about me. I knew it wouldn’t last.’ On the other hand, you may be thinking, ‘We’re just going through a rough patch, but we’ll work it out and our relationship will last!’” says Ms. Kolakowski. Cultivate this positive line of thought in the relationship.

Empathy

Remind and show her that you care about her. Your assurance should not end with a verbal reminder. Nairobi-based psychologist Patrick Musau says that you should strive to know the heart of your partner while she’s at her worst. “Establish what her hidden needs and feelings are. That way, you will be meeting her halfway through her recovery journey. In turn, she will be more willing to open up to you or to help,” he says.

Communication method

Find new ways to communicate that will make your partner feel heard, validated, and close to you. Change your communication method if it is not connecting the two of you. Bear in mind that being connected does not include making your partner feel that they are a burden to you. “Such thoughts could push them over the edge in the delusion that they will be easing your troubles,” cautions Mr. Musau.

130,News,"The existence of debt has both social and financial costs.


By 
Ritesh Barot


 Business & Financial Analyst 



It takes years for a tree to grow but moments to be felled, likewise, debt and economic crises can obstruct and reverse decades of gains in per capita incomes and thwart efforts of poverty reduction in developing countries. The existence of debt has both social and financial costs.

According to UN Development Programme, “heavily indebted poor countries have higher rates of infant mortality, disease, illiteracy, and malnutrition than other countries in the developing world”. Japan, a very wealthy nation with the third largest financial assets in the world also happens to have the greatest debt, however, they have avoided a situation of debt crisis as they can manage their borrowings.

Over the recent past, many economies have fallen prey to the debt crisis. Going back to 2008, the collapse of Iceland's banking system caused a financial emergency and its impact spread across to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain as well as other neighbouring countries. The crisis led to the collapse of their economic and financial wellbeing. This year we witnessed the Sri Lankan debt crisis.

Once considered a great success in the developing world for meeting basic human needs as a low-income country in the late 1970s, Sri Lanka is in the epicentre of the worst debt and economic emergency since the country’s independence in 1948 and the nation is on the brink of bankruptcy. This situation was brought on by a cycle of ever-increasing foreign debt, changes in weather patterns that negatively affected the crop harvests and exports, the onset of Covid-19 leading to a series of lockdowns, soaring inflation, shortages in fuel supply, an enormous deficit in the economy’s balance of payment, and drastic depletion of foreign currency reserves and progressive devaluation of the currency.

As per the 2021 World Economic Forum Global Risk report, “147 governments have defaulted on debts since 1960”. As per the IMF reports, there have been increased disbursements of loans to nations, particularly across Africa and Asia as Covid-19 has raised debt distress predominantly in low-income nations and emerging market economies. Is it a rare occurrence that the rising of sovereign debts to all-time highs causes bankruptcy status? Zambia borrowed $12 billion from international creditors and has defaulted on debt repayment. Other noteworthy countries which have defaulted or restructured debt after non-payment since the year 2020 besides Zambia and Sri Lanka include Lebanon, Belize, Argentina, Suriname and many others. Lebanon was once referred to as “Switzerland of Middle East” for its economic power in the region, and today it is on the brink of bankruptcy.

What has caused the debt crisis to be so prevalent now? Many countries have suffered due to the economic downturn brought on by Covid-19, thereafter the continued impact on supply chains has led to a shortage of essentials leading to escalating costs of goods. Geopolitics has damaged the situation even further, from the Russia-Ukraine war, down to regional politics. Several countries across Africa have a debt totalling more than 70 percent of their Gross Domestic Product. This was confirmed by an IMF report indicating countries including South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Eritrea, Congo, Angola, Mozambique, and others are on the watch list for being heavily indebted. Kenya is faring well compared to some African counterparts, however, we have our challenges too.

The government of Kenya defaulted on debt repayment of three loans amounting to Sh5.1 billion from an international bank in the financial year ending June 2021. The loans defaulted on were secured for the construction of Arror, Itare, and Kimwarer dams. This was revealed by the auditor general in an audit report on the country’s public debt. Kenya’s public debt currently stands at Sh8.4 trillion. The government maintained that the country’s debt is sustainable and there is no cause for alarm. General public debt has been a subject of intense debate even as the National Treasury has maintained that at the debt level being 69 percent of the country’s gross domestic product the economy and public remain in a safe space. Nancy Gathungu, Auditor General of Kenya stated “taxpayer is bearing the burden of incurring commitment fees for loans that National Treasury is yet to disburse”. These revelations by the auditor general are at a time when the National Treasury has proposed through the 2022 finance bill a revision of the Kenyan debt ceiling from the present Sh9 trillion to 55 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. The proposal is currently being deliberated by the National Assembly’s financial planning committee.

Looking at the larger picture, the global economy continues to face challenges. Kenya is not unique with its ever-rising fuel costs, increasing inflation, impacted growth, and tightened financial conditions. This is the predicament faced by many nations. It is no surprise that the world’s poorer nations have taken on an increasing amount of variable rate debt as a share of their total debt increasing their vulnerability to rate hikes. A high and rising stock of government debt risks leading to higher taxes in the future. The ever-rising mountain of debt is expensive to service and has a potentially significant opportunity cost for the government.

High taxes and interest rates can crowd out the private sector as well. Supporters of small governments believe a lot of states' spending on borrowing and servicing loans is wasteful and showcases allocative inefficiency. Cutting national debt allows for lower taxes which can increase both aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the long run.

Is a high level of national debt a concern? This depends in part on the root cause of the debt, both cyclical and structural. It also depends in part on the cost of annual interest payments and repayment terms for new and existing debt. The ability of the government to attract investors to buy new debt is an important factor. What is most important and required is a careful and realistic forecast of the impact of inflation on the real value of unpaid debt and value judgments about how best to fund public services and welfare and which generation should bear the cost of paying this debt. Thomas Jefferson famously quoted “to preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.” Countries must aim at reducing debt and evade the debt trap.

Although contraception methods cater to both men and women, it is often assumed that the burden of contraception lies with the woman.

According to Dr. Petra Boynton, a psychologist, and author of The Research Companion, some partners fear that initiating conversations about contraception in a relationship will be misinterpreted as a gateway to infidelity. “Others fear that talking frankly might seem overbearing or be perceived as a passion killer. The contraceptive conversation may also seem to question the level of trust in the relationship,” she says.

Research by the Guttmacher Institute on the use of contraception at different stages of relationships found that the timing and method will strongly depend on the type and strength of the relationship. For instance, in the early stages of a relationship, many women will show an urgency to negotiate for condom use while men will show motivation to practice contraception. “As the relationship progresses, many couples tend to abandon condoms and adopt traditional methods out of mythical fear such as infertility. After the birth of the first child, couples will prefer modern contraceptives to space children. However, the side effects often lead women to switch methods or discontinue contraception,” the study found.

In Kenya, implants are ranked as the second most used contraception method after injectables. According to a 2018 review report Lift Off: the Blossoming of Contraceptive Implant Use in Africa, out of every 100 married women who use contraception, 30 use implants. In 2019, Kenya surpassed its FP2020 commitment to increase the use of modern methods of family planning among married women to 58 percent. According to the report, FP2020: Women at the Centre, Kenya has a modern contraceptive usage rate of 60 percent. Also, according to figures from the Ministry of Health, the contraceptive prevalence rate has been rising steadily over the past decade in Kenya. This growth has been widely noticeable among women in marriage. For example, between 2009 and 2019, the rate of contraception use among married women in Kenya increased from 46 percent to 58 percent. “There is a positive ripple effect from this rise as more contraception use means fewer unwanted pregnancies and maternal deaths,” says Dr. Thuthwa.

According to the Economic Survey 2020 report, as of the year 2020, Family Planning (FP) Injections were the most popular method of contraception with 2.3 million women taking it, followed by Combined Oral Contraceptives, which had 681.6 thousand women. With permanent family planning methods, the number of females undergoing Sterilisation Tubal Ligation was 4,435 while male Sterilisation Vasectomy had 334 men only. The report showed a general decline in the uptake of modern contraceptive methods, except for pills which continued to increase.

According to Dr. Janet Thuthwa, an Obstetrician-Gynecologist, decreased sexual desire is among the side effects that women using hormonal contraceptives experience. “The link between mental health and reduced libido is not farfetched. Sexual activity among women is to the largest extent mentally induced,” she says. Other side effects associated with hormonal contraception include inter-menstrual spotting and breakthrough bleeding, missing periods, heavy periods, weight gain, headaches and migraine, and breast tenderness.

The procedure for vasectomy usually takes 15 to 30 minutes and is about 99.8 percent effective. It does not affect sexual function or pleasure. Where men have refused to undergo vasectomy, women have had to adopt riskier methods such as tubal ligation (surgical sealing of fallopian tubes). According to Dr. Ramon Suarez, the managing director of No-Scalpel Vasectomy International, the failure of vasectomy could only mean that a child might be sired accidentally, whereas the failure of tube ligation could end up claiming the life of the woman.

Apart from being a protective sheath against sexual infections, condoms are also a form of contraception. However, in relationships, condoms tend to face a mountain of myths. For instance, a study on how men in Mombasa rationalised sex without contraception found that many men feel using condoms for contraception denies women sexual pleasure. They also feared that condoms as contraceptives caused pain rather than a pleasure to their women due to friction.

Ultimately, you will need to make a decision on which method of contraception suits you. Learn about all the available options – both hormonal and non-hormonal and their risks and benefits. According to Dr. Boynton, it is a red flag if your partner refuses to use condoms when you want to, or belittles other contraception choices you may have made.


Vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities.


If your prostate gland including the seminal vesicles is removed during surgery, you will have dry orgasms during intercourse, according to the PCF journal.

128,News,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Women's health is a broad and complex topic, encompassing everything from reproductive health to mental health and everything in between. There are a host of health concerns that women should be aware of, from heart disease and cancer to osteoporosis and depression.

By being informed and taking proactive steps to maintain their health, women can live long, happy, and healthy lives. Here are just a few of the most important health concerns women need to know about. 

Depression is a common mental health disorder that can have a wide range of negative impacts on a person's life. Both sexes as well as young adults are vulnerable to depression.

Depression can seriously impact physical health, relationships, work performance, and quality of life. It can even lead to suicide.

Thus, it is essential that women learn about depression and what they can do if they think they might be developing the condition.

Gynaecological health issues are a broad category that can affect the female reproductive system. Common gynaecological problems include endometriosis , urinary incontinence, and pelvic pain.

These conditions can significantly impact a woman's quality of life, causing pain, discomfort, and fertility problems.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are another common gynaecological concern. STIs can cause a range of symptoms and if left untreated, can lead to serious health problems.

Cancer is a broad term for a group of diseases that cause abnormal cell growth. Cancer can affect any part of the body, and there are many diverse types.

Cancer is a leading cause of death in women, with breast cancer being the most common type. Other common types of cancer that affect women include ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer.

With early detection and treatment, many types of cancer are highly curable.

Maternal health refers to women's health during pre-conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period.

Pregnancy is a time of great physical and emotional change, and it is important for women to be aware of the potential risks and complications.

By being informed and taking care of themselves, women reduce their risk of developing problems during pregnancy and ensure a healthy outcome for themselves and their babies.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, yet many women are unaware of their risk. There are many different types of heart disease, and the symptoms can vary depending on the type. However, common signs include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and irregular heartbeat.

Women need to maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and avoid smoking.

This health condition occurs when bones become weak, making them susceptible to fractures. Although osteoporosis is most common in older adults, it can affect people of any age. Women are particularly at risk for this condition.

However, there are several things women can do to reduce their risk of developing this health condition. For example, getting enough calcium and vitamin D, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking can help keep bones healthy and strong.

If you are concerned about osteoporosis, talk to your doctor about ways to reduce your risk. Knowing the signs and symptoms of this condition is also important so that you can seek treatment if necessary.


As with other conditions related to pregnancy, fluctuating hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth are usually the triggers of hair loss.


Among children under the age of five years, low birth weight was the eighth cause of hospital admissions, accounting for 2.6 percent of all child hospitalisations that were recorded in 2020. 


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.


From 25 per cent households headed by a single parent in 2009, the number had shot to a staggering four out of 10 three years ago

127,News,"Do not obsess about the person your partner cheated on you with.


By 
Simon Mburu


Reporter

Nation Media Group



Can cheating make a marriage stronger? According to a five-year research project by the University of Washington published in the Journal of Couple and Family Psychology: Research and Practice, it is possible for couples who have suffered infidelity to enjoy post-affair marital stability and trustworthiness in the same way as couples who didn’t suffer infidelity. “Infidelity does not have to be the end of a relationship. Couples can work through infidelity, restore their relationship, and enjoy a stable and satisfying marital relationship,"" the researchers wrote. Additionally, ""When infidelity is confessed as opposed to discovered, both partners may be more willing to work on restoring the relationship."" According to the research project, couples who survived infidelity were those who willingly subjected themselves to relationship counseling sessions.

Why did it happen?

According to Zelda West-Meads, a marriage researcher and the author of To Love, Honour and Betray, working out what went wrong is the first and ultimate goal that should salvage your marriage. “When you have talked through, and have decided the affair is over and you still want your marriage, work out what went wrong,” she says. For instance, it could be that you were neglecting each other’s emotional and sexual needs. Research conducted using data from the dating site AshleyMadison.com revealed 67 percent of women who cheat on their husbands are essentially looking for passion and sex but have zero interest in ending their marriages. “These findings reflect not marital disharmony, but the sexual monotony; a social fact in long-term monogamous relationships like marriage. The longer a relationship progresses, the more likely the quality and the frequency of sex will fade. We get used to and bored of the same body,” said Eric Anderson, the lead researcher, and professor of masculinity, sexuality, and sport at the University of Winchester, England.

Separate sexual life

Your partner may have looked for a separate sexual life in a bid to feel more wanted, lusted after, attractive, and or appreciated. Psychologist Ken Munyua says such needs and wants point to deeper, emotional problems bedeviling the marriage. Your partner will rarely cheat with a stranger, it will be an acquaintance they have been engaging with under the guise of ‘Just friends’. According to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, platonic relationships where one party is married hold great potential to evolve into emotional affairs that quickly include emotional intimacy, secrecy, and sexual chemistry at levels higher than those in the marriage.

Turning the page

Ironically, cheating could be the fodder your marriage needed to grow stronger! However, you will need to evaluate what you needed or wanted or weren’t getting in your union. “Maybe your drive to seek sex elsewhere can illuminate the fact that your sex life is not optimal or that you haven’t been working towards a satisfying sex life. Perhaps you’ve not been feeling validated in the areas of love or sex and that drove you to seek a connection with someone else,” says Michael Broder, a psychologist and author of Can Your Relationship Be Saved? How to Know Whether to Stay or Go.

A marriage will only reap from the act of unfaithfulness if both the guilty and innocent parties are willing to walk the rough road towards total reconciliation. “You failed to tackle the elephant in your bedroom prior to the affair. If you don’t confront it head-on immediately, you can rest assured your marriage is a house of cards that could blow off any minute,” he says.

Finally, if your spouse cheated and you are working on a reconciliation, avoid dredging up the past whenever you have an argument. “Do not obsess about the person your partner cheated on you with either, doing so will entrench your pain while reinforcing your anger and disdain,” says Dr. Broder. “Choose to develop a civil and thoughtful discussion about what needs to change and, or be worked on immediately to get your marriage on the path to recovery.”


It emerged that a last-minute intervention by President Kenyatta facilitated Musyoka’s return to the Azimio fold.

Have you ever been to a restaurant and remarked “Oh my goodness, this food is too much for this price!” Char- Choma restaurant in Mombasa just before White Sands hotel is a game changer on this aspect and this is what impressed me most about the restaurant. 

The restaurant allows you to customise your own dining experience based on how much you can eat and your taste. You walk in, get a variety of raw meat (chicken, beef, lamb and pork) which are weighed per 100 grams from as low as Sh65 depending on the choice of meat. You get to choose whether you want your meat charcoal grilled or oven-baked although at an extra cost. The same goes to the sides like fried rice, potato wedges, sauté, fries, ugali, etc. My go-to meal was the pork chops, pork rashers, potato wedges and kachumbari. All meals are freshly prepared on order and are super tasty.

Minimal waste and happy tummies is Char-Choma for you. The ambience compliments the dining experience as it is mainly a sea-view restaurant that offers different sitting experiences. The inside feels warm, laid back, has high ceilings and eclectic décor that brings the space to life. It is also quite spacious and private. The top deck doubles up as the bar area and the atmosphere shouts “can-we-grab-a-drink on a Sunday afternoon?”. It is beautifully furnished with low white and grey seats and one rocking seat at the corner.

Then, there is the outdoor space - the patio and the tents by the beach, where you get to bask in the sun, enjoy the soft touches of the ocean breeze on your face and the grains of sand on the feet as you enjoy your Nyama Choma. An early (late) evening will give you a view of the sun sinking into horizon of the ocean, with a cotton candy view of the sky.

The children’s play area and an open air swimming pool is fitted with slides and swings to satisfy the curiosity of the kids, besides building sand castles on the beach. Actually, the swimming pool is the first feature you will notice as you walk into the restaurant. 



All with the picturesque view of the Indian Ocean. These features make it a restaurant to seek out for, when in Mombasa.

Brian Ambani


Nation Media Group



The Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) has moved to purchase equipment for the rollout of cellular network coverage in 12 counties that are unserved or underserved with mobile network infrastructure.

The authority has called for bids for firms to undertake construction of communication towers that host Base Transceiver Station (BTS) equipment and establishment of backhaul transmission links to operators’ Base Station Controllers (BSCs) and the core networks to be built within 24 months.

The move aims to boost mobile network coverage in the areas where residents have to walk long distances to get network coverage to use their phones, browse the internet and access mobile money services.

“The scope of the project is 67 sub-locations in 12 different counties which have been identified as potential candidates for Phase 3 Cellular Mobile Infrastructure Development project,” said CA in a tender call.

“The project is based on the tower co model that separates telecommunications mobile passive infrastructure and telecommunications mobile active infrastructure.”

The stations will be built in Garissa, Kitui, Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo and Samburu. Other counties include Narok, Lamu, Turkana, Taita Taveta, Wajir and West Pokot.

This comes as Kenya’s telecoms sector has experienced robust growth as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic that pushed consumers to adopt online ways of conducting business and mobile money payments as safer modes of accessing and paying for goods and services.

Other key drivers include increased demand for video calls, social networking, gaming and video on demand.

The government targets to reach 101 sub locations that have inadequate or no cellular network access across 19 counties by the end of this month in Phase II of the project to a tune of Sh1.1 billion.

The phase saw 14 sub locations in West Pokot connected to mobile network in April this year including schools to support the rollout of the new competency-based curriculum (CBC).

124,News,"Caffeine addiction can cause people to become irritable and moody when they do not get their fix.


By 
Fiona Muthoni




Caffeine addiction is a severe problem that affects millions of people around the world. Health effects include insomnia, anxiety, and heart problems. While caffeine may have been considered merely a harmless drug for those who need a morning boost or an afternoon pick-me-up, it has become clear that caffeine is addictive and dangerous.

Caffeine, also known as trimethyl xanthine, is a psychoactive stimulant found in coffee, tea, and chocolate. It has numerous functions including increasing alertness, boosting energy levels, improving performance during physical and mental tasks, and suppressing sleep. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, which are responsible for slowing down neural activity. This stops the ""sleepiness"" signal to the brain, so you will feel more awake for more extended periods.

Caffeine is a drug that affects everyone differently. Moderate amounts can give people an energy boost and make them more alert. Still, it is highly addictive and causes withdrawal symptoms if you suddenly stop consuming caffeine after being dependent on it for a long time. Some people can handle caffeine, and it doesn't affect them much while others suffer from side effects like irritability, headaches, nausea, insomnia, increased heartbeat, abnormal heart rate, and high blood pressure.

Caffeine addiction can cause people to become irritable and moody when they do not get their fix, which leads to a vicious cycle of drinking even more caffeine in an attempt to feel better. Many caffeine addicts are constantly tired, yet they drink coffee to try and stay awake.

Excessive consumption of caffeine can also lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is important for those addicted to cut back on the amount they consume before their addiction takes a toll on other aspects of their lives.

Other withdrawal symptoms include:

Gradually cut back on the amount of caffeine you consume each day. For example, if you drink a cup of black coffee in the morning, switch to half caffeinated and half decaf during the second week. Then switch from drinking two cups per day to one or none.

Caffeine is a drug that affects everyone differently and should be treated with caution. If you're suffering from withdrawal symptoms after stopping caffeine consumption, then it's time to cut back on your intake before a full-blown addiction sets in. However, for those who cannot quit, there are healthy alternatives such as:

Alternatives:

Caffeinated drinks such as coffee can be replaced with decaffeinated beverages, herbal teas, or hot chocolate.


If you already have a mental health condition, it is advisable to avoid alcohol until the issue has been addressed. 


Since coffee can be both helpful and harmful depending on the dose, find a level of consumption that is healthy for you.

123,News,"Beer bottles on the assembly line in a modern brewery.



In 2015, the state launched a campaign against illicit liquor in central Kenya. Although police raided several dens and arrested some suspects, the campaign flopped. To many, this failure did not come as a surprise because it was clear from the beginning that the government did not have a good strategy and did not fully understand the problem.

The government assumed that closing illicit liquor dens and arresting people [was the] magic [bullet] that would stop locals from imbibing killer brews. This was too much to expect under any circumstance especially given the level of corruption in the law enforcement department.

Anybody who understands the alcohol crisis in central Kenya will admit that it’s largely tied to graft. This means that any strategy that involves the forceful closure of liquor dens can’t work unless corruption is tackled. It will be naive to think that corruption is going anywhere, anytime soon, because it’s now part of our culture.  However, all is not lost. We can still deal with this crisis in a different way.

For many years, we’ve been made to believe that the people of central Kenya are the only ones drinking themselves silly. Well, the truth is that the alcohol crisis is felt in almost every part of the country save for the drought-stricken areas.

We have also been made to think that the crisis is driven by over-consumption of alcohol. For the record, the problem is caused by the quality and not the quantity of alcohol consumed.

Drinking too much alcohol has no potential of creating a crisis. The British and Dutch people consume more beer per person compared to Kenyans, but there has never been a drinking crisis in these countries. This is because genuine beer in these two countries is affordable such that even the poor can afford it.

I was shocked the other day to learn that alcohol in the Netherlands costs almost the same price as bottled water. In other words, if you can afford water, you can afford beer. This means it’s almost impossible to contemplate selling illicit liquor in these countries.

It is, therefore, safe to conclude that the only way we can successfully deal with the alcohol crisis in central Kenya is by zero-rating the tax on beer. The aim is to match the price of beer with that of illicit brew. The moment this is achieved, we will have successfully eliminated the need for people to take dangerous illicit brew, because the popularity of illicit liquor is tied to its affordability.

If well implemented, this strategy can kick Kumikumi dealers out of business within six months. Dealers will literally and willingly close their dens due to scarcity of customers. This strategy has been tried and tested in the UK and the Netherlands and there is no reason why we can’t implement it here.

The implementation of this solution will no doubt have a negative impact on the taxes collected by Kenya Revenue Authority, but the negative effect will be short-lived since more youths from central Kenya will become economically active and this will help generate jobs and revenues.

122,News,"A woman on vacation. 


By 
Dudley Muchiri


Print journalist 

Nation Media Group



It’s ‘Njaanuary’, and a vacation is probably the last thing on your mind right now. And rightly so, because you have to meet your essential needs first, right? However, travel experts believe that even a January vacation is possible as it all boils down to planning. 

Muthuri Kinyamu, the co-founder of Turnup Travel, believes that everyone can enjoy travel one that is within their means and does not leave them struggling to meet other essential needs.

He holds that these ten tips can help you and your loved ones achieve your travel dreams and aspirations:

The key to achieving any goals is having a proper plan, and travelling is no different.

Planning travel months before it happens gives you ample time to decide on activities to do during the travel, a wider pool of accommodation and travel options and most importantly, enough time to pool your resources.

Booking flights earlier is also cheaper.

Planning within one’s income is essential as it safeguards you from making unfeasible financial decisions. There is no perfect travel destination or a perfect number of days to be on vacation, as all these things vary between people. You can choose to travel to an expensive destination for a day or two or travel to a less costly one for more days.

To encourage more travelling and attract more customers, travel agencies, the transport industry, hotels, and travel destinations will regularly come up with offers to help travellers make huge savings. Taking advantage of this can help you travel to your dream destination on a budget, or help you engage in more activities on your travel or travel more.

Travelling during holiday seasons when many people are travelling can be quite costly, as the demand is high and the travel industry capitalises on this. A workaround on this can, however, help you make great savings. Suppose people are travelling to Mombasa during Christmas for instance. In that case, you can choose to travel to other less travelled to destinations like national parks and reserves in other regions in the country.

When you travel to a destination, do not be afraid to explore and interact with the local community. On top of giving you a fulfilling experience as you get to enjoy the culture and new things, it can also help you save some money. Instead of eating at highly-priced restaurants, you can try out local restaurants and cuisines, as well as other street delicacies as may be recommended by the locals you interact with.

With the growing travel demands and a dynamic pool of travellers from varying economic statuses, accommodation offerings have greatly evolved.

From as low as one thousand a night to as high as hundreds of thousands, everyone can afford to spend a night at a place of their own choice. The growing culture of Airbnbs enables you to have your ideal stay within the comfort of your budget.

Should you choose to stay in a hotel, for instance, while on international travel where choices may be limited, pay for the half-board where you just get accommodation and breakfast. This will reduce the amount you pay and give you the freedom to move around, go site-seeing, and interact and experience new and varying cultures.

Planning as a group of friends, work colleagues, family or any other social entity can help you pool resources and greatly reduce individual travel budget. For instance, renting a condo together, hiring a boat or a chef or engaging in group activities becomes cheaper when there is cost-sharing.

Whether travelling for work or for a ruracio (dowry payment) in a new destination you are yet to explore, you can take advantage of this and take a day or two after you are finished with your main business, to experience the new location and adventure.

For a lot of people, travel is usually a luxury reserved for when all the other needs have been met.

Therefore, this means that many people end up postponing their plans or end up never going altogether. However, making travel a part of your life and planning on it while budgeting on other things slowly integrates the habit and ensures consistency in your travels.

121,News,"Beer is usually is associated with weight gain, especially in the lower abdomen.

It’s almost impossible to go to a social event that does not have alcohol. Whether the attendees intend to celebrate or mourn, there will be bottles on the table. You may also find yourself regularly drinking with friends during your free time, making alcohol slowly entrench itself as part of your life, which can lead to addiction or alcohol dependence.

Over time, uncontrolled drinking can lead to physical and mental health issues.

Alcohol is broken down in the liver. If you take a small amount of alcohol, the liver can regenerate. However, liver regeneration may not be possible if you drink too much at once or too often.

Not many people appreciate the full extent of the effects of alcohol on the liver. The major alcohol-related liver diseases (ARLD) include:

Although not usually listed as an ARDL, liver cancer has also been associated with alcohol intake.

If you experience any of the following signs and symptoms, get checked for liver disease: 

There is no cure for ARLD but you can only manage by quitting alcohol and embracing a healthy lifestyle.

Recent studies suggest that people who drink moderately are less likely to suffer heart diseases compared to those who don’t drink at all.

Experts have however poked holes into these studies, indicating that the studies were not controlled for many factors and were thus unreliable. For instance, it is possible that some of the non-drinkers already had health conditions, which is why they didn’t drink alcohol in the first place.

The counterstudies also suggest that most of those who can drink a few glasses of wine regularly were well-off and could afford a healthy lifestyle and quality healthcare.

Heavy drinking or long-term moderate drinking has been linked to hypertension, heart failure, or stroke.

Excessive drinking, especially beer, also leads to obesity, which is a risk factor for high blood pressure and other heart illnesses.

Some studies show that alcohol leads to weight gain, others show it results in weight loss, while others show no correlation.

In all the studies, however, it is consistently clear that what you drink, the frequency, and how much you drink determine the effect of alcohol on your weight. Diet, genetics, physical activity, and age are also significant factors.

Beer is usually associated with weight gain, especially in the lower abdomen. The weight gain may be caused by the high number of calories in beer. It has also been theorised that beer lowers metabolic rate.

Inversely, excessive weight loss may occur when the person takes lots of alcohol and does not eat nutritious food.

Weight fluctuations associated with alcohol are not healthy because they alter your body balance and weaken your body, especially the immune system, predisposing you to severe illnesses.

Alcohol hinders the part of your brain associated with self-control through inhibitors, which allows you to relax and have fun.

Unfortunately, the feel-good mood lasts a short while as the hangover takes over the next day. If the cycle is repeated frequently, it disrupts your brain's chemical balance, leading to dependency or addiction.

In turn, dependency and addiction damage your personal life, goals, and relationships, leading to other mental conditions, including anxiety and depression.

By moderating how often and how much alcohol you take, you can avoid addiction and other mental illnesses.

If you already have a mental health condition, it is advisable to avoid alcohol until the issue has been addressed.

Bipolar disorder is a condition characterised by extreme mood swings.

You may not know that your partner has bipolar disorder unless they tell you, especially when you are still dating. There may be signs such as your partner being happy and excited one moment, and very irritable, sad, and lonely the next moment. These highs and lows of bipolar are so unrelated that up to 70 percent of patients are misdiagnosed at least once. These mood swings can make navigating a relationship with someone who has bipolar challenging. However, there are things you can do to support your partner and ensure the health of your relationship.

According to psychotherapist Jael Aluoch, if you suspect that your partner has bipolar disorder, the first step is to get a professional diagnosis. This can be done at a mental health facility by a qualified psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Bipolar is a lifelong condition characterised by three main symptoms; mania, hypomania, and depression. With mania, your spouse will be in high spirits and may engage in behaviours such as spending sprees, drug abuse, poor decision making, impulsive behaviour, and unprotected sex. “The behavior changes will be noticeable and can result in trouble at work or in the relationship,” says Aluoch. With hypomania, the symptoms will not be as prominent as mania. “In the depressive extreme, your partner may become suicidal or exhibit suicidal thoughts, they may look sad, bored, and unable to sleep at night,” says Aluoch.

To avoid misunderstanding your partner, get as much knowledge as you can about bipolar. Know the symptoms and how they kick in. According to Aluoch, this will enable you to know when your spouse’s mood or behaviours are out of control. “Knowledge is the only way you will understand where your partner is coming from, how to encourage them to express themselves, and how to show them that treatment can improve the quality of their life and your relationship,” she says.

People with bipolar are highly irritable. In your conversations, avoid arguments and topics that stir irritability or undue euphoria. “Too much euphoria or irritability leads to irrational decisions in people with bipolar,” says Aluoch.  Learn to actively pay attention to what they say and stay calm and attentive during conversations.

According to Dr. Tracy Todd, a family therapist and author of Practice Building for Mental Health Professionals, identify and enhance things that help your spouse maintain a healthy mental trajectory within your environment. “When your spouse is in a stable or more favorable mood, pay close attention to what environmental triggers precipitated and are maintaining the stability. Use these soothers to maintain the mood you both desire,” says Dr. Todd. You may also encourage your spouse to pursue activities they previously enjoyed without compromising his mental wellbeing.

According to the International Bipolar Foundation, one of the best ways to encourage a spouse to stick with the treatment schedule is to accompany them during therapy sessions. “Your spouse’s bipolar diagnosis will inevitably affect you. But accompanying them will ensure that the larger family dynamics are not neglected.” Be careful not to push or be heavy-handed. Your support should be empathetic.

According to Dr. Sidra Goldman-Mellor, a health researcher and the author of Health Effects of Economic Decline, patients with bipolar disorder have a remarkably high risk of suicide. Regardless of whether your spouse has seen a professional, you will need to keep tabs on them to nip suicidal thoughts in the bud. “Someone looking to commit suicide is hard to identify. Everything about them will look right until the very last moments when they engage in illogical activities,” says psychologist Dr. Chris Hart.  Your partner could seem euphoric, but inside they may be heavily laden with stress and depression so stay alert.

You must be able to love and care for yourself before you can love and care for your partner. Caring for a person with bipolar disorder can be draining. Be honest about your feelings, behaviors, and reactions to the things happening around you. “Consciously observe your feelings, sensations, habits, behaviours, and thoughts,” says Dr. Hart. Beware of your negative traits and tendencies that trigger your partner’s negative reactions. These include the habit of exaggerating, shooting from the hip or jumping to wrong conclusions.




It is important for men to be supportive and wait until their partner is ready for intimacy.

118,News,"From left: Real Madrid's Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior, Real Madrid's Welsh forward Gareth Bale and Real Madrid's French defender Ferland Mendy look at the ball during a training session at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis on May 27, 2022, on the eve of their UEFA Champions League final match against Liverpool FC. 


By 
AFP




Gareth Bale wrote a farewell letter to Real Madrid on Wednesday, the Welshman bringing an end to his nine-year spell at the Spanish club, where he said his ""dream became a reality"".

Bale will leave Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of June, with the 32-year-old yet to confirm what he will do next.

His future is likely to depend on whether Wales qualify for the World Cup in Qatar, with retirement a possible option if they miss out.

""I write this message to say thank you to all my teammates, past and present, my managers, the backroom staff and to the fans that supported me,"" Bale wrote in a letter to Real Madrid, posted on social media in both English and Spanish.

""I arrived here nine years ago as a young man who wanted to realise my dream of playing for Real Madrid. To wear the pristine white kit, to wear the crest on my chest, to play at the Santiago Bernabeu, to win titles and to be part of what it's so famous for, to win the Champions League.

""I can now look back, reflect and say with honesty that this dream became a reality and much, much more.

""To be a part of this club's history and to achieve what we achieved while I was a Real Madrid player has been an incredible experience and one I will never forget.

""I also want to thank president Florentino Perez, Jose Angel Sanchez and the board for giving me the opportunity to play for this club. Together we were able to create some moments that will live forever in the history of this club and football. It has been an honour.""

After joining Madrid from Tottenham for 100 million euros in 2013, Bale went on to win 16 major trophies with Real Madrid, including five Champions Leagues, three La Ligas and one Copa del Rey.

He also won three Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups and a Spanish Super Cup.

More than his trophies, Bale will be remembered for a handful of spectacular moments, including his two goals scored off the bench against Liverpool in the 2018 Champions League final in Kiev, the first coming from a stunning bicycle kick.

He scored another hugely important goal in the 2014 Champions League final in Lisbon, his header at the back post giving Real Madrid the lead against Atletico Madrid in extra-time, as they went on to win the club's long-awaited 10th European Cup.

Perhaps most memorable was Bale's incredible solo goal at Mestalla to win the 2014 Copa del Rey final against Barcelona.

Bale's popularity with the Real Madrid fans, though, has plummeted in recent years as injuries and a perceived lack of commitment pushed him to the fringes of the first team.

He was barely on speaking terms with Zinedine Zidane by the end of the 2017-18 season and hopes that Cristiano Ronaldo's departure might revive his Real Madrid career were never realised.

A frosty relationship with the Spanish press harmed his reputation, with aspects of his personal life - including his passion for playing golf and a lack of fluency in Spanish - increasingly used to support the idea he had lost interest in his Real Madrid career.

The issue exploded in 2019 after Bale celebrated Wales' qualification for Euro 2020 by standing behind a flag that read: ""Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.""

Despite his heroics in the Champions League final in 2018, Bale's role had already been significantly reduced that season under Zidane and his influence continued to dwindle even as new coaches like Julen Lopetegui, Santiago Solari, Zidane again, and most recently, Carlo Ancelotti, took charge.

Last season, Bale played only five times in La Liga and seven minutes in the Champions League, again saving his best for Wales, as he scored a hat-trick against Belarus in September and then twice against Austria in March to keep their World Cup qualification hopes alive.

117,News,"More and more men are avoiding the doctor. Or worse, not going at all.


By 
Denis Mutua




Studies show that, compared to women, men are less likely to visit a doctor for regular checkups, or when something is not right.

Healthcare workers report having to send family members to persuade their male relatives to visit the hospital.

What could be behind men’s poor health-seeking behavior?

Can anything be done to convince them that a visit to the doctor is good for them?

When asked why they avoid hospitals and doctors in general, most men say they believe they will get better on their own. This can be interpreted as either overblown confidence in themselves or downplaying the gravity of a possible illness. Experts theorise this as the superhero syndrome at play. Most men consider falling ill a sign of vulnerability and weakness. They believe people will perceive them as weak if they visit a doctor.

Some doctors believe men stay away from hospitals because of the fear of bad news. A typical man would rather take painkillers for life for migraine than being informed that they have a tumor.

Men also fear “shameful feedback” about sensitive issues such as fertility and erectile dysfunction. This makes many opt to solve the problem on their own by taking supplements or even blaming their partners for their woes.

Finally, it is also possible that men are afraid of some diagnostic and treatment procedures. For example, colonoscopy and tests for prostrate can be quite uncomfortable.

Many lifestyle diseases have ‘silent symptoms’ which can only be detected through regular checkups. Therefore, by avoiding doctors, men rob themselves of the chance of an early diagnosis.

Late diagnosis means an illness has advanced, sometimes irreversibly or the patient may have to undergo expensive and intensive treatments.

This mentality could also harm dependents who are in the care of men. A man who can’t book checkup appointments for himself is unlikely to make such arrangements for others.

These men may also expect their sons and other male relatives to toughen up and dissuade them from going to the hospital often.

Here are some suggestions:

Many men have reported going to a doctor just to get their partners to stop nagging. With such an incentive, many women will persuade their partners to see a doctor.

Some researchers have suggested that women go for checkups more often because they understand their health better than men. Campaigns to sensitize men on the need for checkups could improve their perception of doctor visits.

Men who consider going to the doctor as emasculating are also unlikely to disclose all their medical information. However, they are usually open to older male doctors because they perceive them as qualified and experienced.

Although millennial men have shown more enthusiasm towards seeking medical attention, compared to men of older generations, there is still a gap that calls for efforts towards changing men’s mindsets about seeking healthcare.


Vasectomy has no impact on sexual performance, orgasm, sexual desire, ejaculation, and erectile capabilities.

American tech giant Apple has recorded the fastest growth in global smartphone sales in Quarter 1 of the year to beat global supply chain disruptions induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Data released by Lithuanian e-commerce firm Burga shows Apple registered a 20 per cent growth in its share of the global smartphone market in Q1 this year compared to Q1 of 2021 beating its South Korean competitor Samsung which grew its market share by 9 per cent.

However, the South Korean tech giant retained its lead as the world’s largest smartphone seller increasing its share to 24 per cent up from 22 per cent while Apple trails at 18 per cent up from a 15 per cent market share last year.

Other smartphone manufacturers registered a drop in market share, led by Oppo and Vivo, both by 20 per cent. Xiaomi's share also dropped 7.14 per cent, while other manufacturers have seen their share plunge by 3.57 per cent.

Burga noted that Apple’s growth was driven by regular updates of new features to its phones and innovative designs as well as tapping onto its loyal customer base despite its smartphones being more expensive compared to those of its rivals.

“Interestingly, Apple is gaining ground in market share despite the company's smartphones mainly being considered expensive compared to competitors. It can be assumed that the devices are gaining more appeal with the company leveraging its loyal consumer base that is attracted by the devices' regular new features and the overall innovative designs,” said the e-commerce firm.

The firm said the smartphone market is set to be shaped by how the competing firms will individually manage to deal with the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors.

The world has been hit by a shortage of semiconductor chips for over a year following a rapid rise in demand for the chips that has outstripped supply hitting hard manufacturers of cars, smartphones, appliances and other products.

“Manufacturers that will adopt mitigation measures like designing in-house semiconductors will likely emerge on top. Additionally, manufacturers that will adapt to new trends like designing budget-specific devices focusing on particular markets will potentially stand out.”

FAITH MUIRURI






Anne Wanjiku Kibe rose to political fame in 2017 after a landslide victory that saw her become the first woman to be elected Gatundu North MP.

Her joy was, however, short-lived when a court nullified her win. This followed a petition by her opponent. She challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court, which upheld her election.

But before the dust could settle, she was slapped with another petition seeking to nullify her election. The petitioner argued that she was not qualified to vie for the seat because on the date of her election she had not resigned as a nominated member of the Kiambu County Assembly.

This set her on the path of unending court battles, which continued until around February this year.

“These were the most-depressing moments of my political career and I had to fight hard to retain the seat and remain on track to deliver on my promises.” 

Read: Wanjiku Kibe promises to transform Gatundu North if elected

And as we approach the August polls, the former radio presenter at Kameme FM is upbeat that she will reclaim the seat and continue her development projects. She is vying against more than five competitors, all men.

“My opponents moved to court because they did not believe in a woman leader, but now they can attest to the transformation in the constituency.”

Among her key achievements over the past five years is the revamp of infrastructure in all the 64 public primary schools in the constituency. Dilapidated facilities have been renovated and now classrooms built.

“I have also ensured that all needy children receive bursary from the CDF bursary kitty.”

On infrastructure, Kibe has also pushed for the rehabilitation and reclassification of the Thika-Gakoe-Magumu-Flyover road from class D under the county government to a national government road. She was able to lobby the national government to tarmac over 150 kilometres of roads.

“I have also established two innovation centres in preparation for operationalisation of our ICT, innovation hub and creative art centres in line with the Ministry of ICT policy.”

She says these hubs will nurture centres that will greatly benefit the youth in this digital era through what is known as Ajira programmes.

Other successes include electrification. “We have installed street lights to improve security and to spur 24-hour economy. We have also managed to light over 25 major centres in partnership with Kenya Power.”

If re-elected, her priorities include setting up an endowment fund to ensure all needy students are fully supported throughout their education. She says the CDF bursary kitty can cover only 35 per cent of beneficiaries, limiting the number of beneficiaries.

On youth empowerment, she says, “We have been able to put up two innovation centres in the constituency that are yet to be operationalised. If elected, I will ensure these centres become functional and construct additional centres in every ward.”

She plans to “create a database of skill sets and then link young people with the private sector” and “establish a technical training institute to ensure majority of the youth are equipped with skills requisite in the market”. 

Kibe holds a Bachelor of Arts (Education) from Kenyatta University and Master of Business Administration from the University of Nairobi. She sits in the Energy and Communication, Information and Innovation committees of Parliament.

She expresses confidence of retaining her seat, adding that not even smear campaigns and character assassination by her opponents will derail her bid.

“Malicious falsehoods and smear campaign won’t work. It was used against me in 2017, but I was elected. My constituents want services, they want a person they can easily identify with, a leader with a development record and one who understands them.”

She is glad that none of her opponents has any tangible evidence against her on non-performance, misuse of Constituency Development Fund, allocation of bursary funds and other public funds.

“I have not been mentioned in any corruption allegations. I am basing my campaigns on my performance. That has made my campaigns easier. I am optimistic of going back to Parliament as Gatundu North MP for a second term,” says a confident Kibe.

In addition, she believes the gender card will work for her. “I have always presented myself as a mother who is regarded highly in the community. My rallying call in this campaign is Njorua ya wira (meaning a champion at work), which resonates with the electorate.”

“Despite the bruising court battles, I have always managed to find enough time to be with my voters.”

She says that it is through these interactions with the electorate that she has learnt a lot on challenges facing them, while accepting and encouraging positive criticisms on her performance.

“This interaction has also given me the opportunity to serve my people better, having first-hand information on issues affecting them. My happiest moments are when I receive feedback from the community on ongoing projects or sharing ideas and discussing issues affecting them.”

On the two thirds gender rule, she points out that Kenya is progressing in creating spaces for women, especially in the political arena, and cites the naming of Martha Karua by the Azimio Coalition Presidential contender as his running mate as remarkable. “This is a very historic moment in this country because we have never had a major presidential candidate picking a woman.”

She urges women to contest political seats but cautions them against playing dirty. “You don’t have to insult your competitors or use vulgar language to be elected. You can still sell your manifesto, be decent and people will vote for you.”

114,News,"Anita Soina, 22 is an environmental activist, founder of SpiceWarriors Kenya an environmental organization, author of The Green War, and a brand Influencer. She hopes to become the next MP for Kajiado North Constituency. 


By 
JOYCE CHIMBI




At just 22 years of age, Anita Soina is woman on a mission. She wants to be the next Member of Parliament (MP) for Kajiado North.

Young, articulate, and a renowned environmentalist, Ms Soina believes that when women lead, rivers run upstream. Her interest in active politics started at a very young age. In 2017, she was already a household name in official campaigns for youthful politicians including Ababu Namwamba.

This time round, she is using the same skills to win a political office through the Green Thinking Action Party (GTAP), which she says aligns with her social change agenda that leans heavily on environmental protection and conservation.

Four years ago, Ms Soina founded SpiceWarriors, an organization that promotes environmental conservation, rallying other young people to protect the universe. A job she has done well.

So why is she running for a political office? Ms Soina says politics plays a central role in environmental governance, social and economic development.  But to address the environmental and social  injustices, accelerate interventions around the protection of the environment and deliver a healthy and safe environment for the people of Kajiado North, she has to be at the decision making table.

Kajiado North Parliamentary aspirant on Green Thinking Action Party Anita Soina receives her nomination certificate from the party leader Isaac Kalua in Nairobi on April 11, 2022.

“Women and children are the most affected by badly crafted policies, yet they are not at the decision making table and in corridors of power, to address these gaps. Women are mothers and sisters and having suffered many challenges, they understand the solutions to problems facing communities today,” she observes.

Women missing on the decision making table is one of the issues she addresses in her book, The Green War. The book highlights her ongoing journey, challenges and future plans to stop environmental degradation. She believes the most pressing problems facing communities today are directly linked to the environment.

“Take for instance water shortages and sanitation related challenges in many households today. It is all linked to climate change. Climate action is in urgent need of immediate attention. When we talk about climate change we are also talking about food security.”

Addressing environmental challenges is, therefore, high on her agenda as a key deliverable to the people of Kajiado. To her, the socio-economic problems facing her people are strongly correlated with environment. Her agenda, therefore, is anchored on environmental conservation, which is viable, practical, cost-effective and importantly, sustainable.

She also wants to address health and insecurity issues. 

“Most of Kajiado North is cosmopolitan as the area includes Ngong’, Rongai and Kiserian. I want to address insecurity, which is closely linked to unemployment, education and even though health is a devolved function, every leader can do something to make health services more accessible.”

“We have a number of hospitals that are not functional. We only have a few public schools and overcrowding makes learning difficult,” she says.

A graduate of Multi-Media University of Kenya with a degree in Bachelor of Arts in Public Relations and Corporate Communication, Ms Soina notes that she is the best for the job of transforming Kajiado North into a fast developing county.

She, however, acknowledges that the task ahead is not an easy one for women, young people and especially young female politicians. The leadership space, she says, is very hostile to women and young people aspiring to be leaders.

Fondly known as ‘green MP’ among her supporters, Ms Soina is well-known for fighting environmental wars. 

“This journey is not about me. I started working as a community volunteer even before I turned 18. My conservation efforts have provided me with a strong network of people and a solid platform on which to launch my political bid.”

She is not participating in politics for the sake of it. “I am deeply invested in my political career. I am a youthful politician and I do not want my political career to be dead on arrival. Unlike a veteran politician, I have too much to lose.”

“Many of our leaders and politicians that we look up to are aging and young leaders are strapping their boots on to be the Martha Karua of tomorrow. When their time to exit the political stage comes, there will be no leadership gap because I and other young leaders are up to the task.”

That the political leadership is slowly changing for women with many seeking leadership positions, is good news.  But to level the political field, Ms Soina stresses the importance of addressing “the toxic nature of our politics.

“Our safety and security is also a concern because we are easily threatened through social media and text messages. This is being used to intimidate us.”

Another major challenge she faces is lack of resources to enable her move around the county and campaign. So is culture and attitudes of and about young people that Ms Soina says is not working for young leaders.

 “Youth voices are not easily heard. Youths call for youthful leadership but are the first ones to get tokenised. It is difficult to enjoy youth support because they also want to eat from you and you cannot feed them the same way a veteran leader can. It is the older people that enjoy youth support.”

Despite these challenges, Ms Soina is very optimistic.

“I have a thick skin and I am focused on the goal, nothing comes easy and no one said it was easy. If women keep pushing, we will get there.”

The 2022 Africities Summit in Kisumu presents an extraordinary opportunity to discuss urbanisation on the continent and boost our tourism after two years of restrictions and lockdowns.

This year’s conference theme is, ‘The Role of Intermediary Cities of Africa in implementing the United Nation’s Vision 2030 and the African Union’s Agenda 2063’.

Goals presented in this development plan seek to create sustainable urban centres that will end poverty and guarantee the enjoyment of peace and prosperity, transforming the continent.

As Africa rapidly urbanises, we need to start planning and developing a coping mechanism for better quality of life. Essential services such as access to safe, clean drinking water, healthcare, nutrition, housing, education, and security should be priorities of African governments.

There is a problem of overcrowding and unemployment.

The cities have the potential for improved business opportunities if they strengthen their urban planning and scale up physical and structural infrastructure.

The Covid-19 pandemic presented a lesson on creating proper supply chains in urban centres. Considering most urban areas in Africa rely on rural areas for food supplies, efforts should be directed to improve the transport network and, where possible urban farming.

Small towns should be merged into urban metropolis to create a robust business environment for growth. For instance, towns along the Kakamega-Kisumu highway should merge to create a vital metropolis connecting Kisumu and Western Kenya.

This will give the city an excellent opportunity to diversify and transform people’s livelihoods.

At the conference, the Sustainability of African cities should be addressed.

In the wake of hyped economic development and transformation efforts, mitigation measures should be implemented to help cities cope with climate change.

This calls for stable governance structures for urban centres. Perhaps we should have departments within counties with elected representatives such as mayors who will be in charge of the administration of cities.

111,News,"Cecily Mbarire displays her nomination certificate to vie for Embu gubernatorial seat on a UDA ticket at Hustler Centre in Nairobi on April 27, 2022. She has her plans laid out for the people of Embu if she wins.


By 
FAITH MUIRURI




When Cecily Mbarire was nominated to parliament in 2003 as a young woman, she was little known. Many people wondered if she had the energy to sustain her stay in politics. They thought it was just a matter to time before she gave up.

She proved them wrong. Ms Mbarire went on to serve as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Runyenjes for 15 years.

Her success in politics is, however, not by chance. She has toiled for it every step. After being nominated to parliament, she worked very hard to endear herself to the electorate, engaging in development projects that changes their lives. It paid off. In 2007, she was elected MP for Runyenjes. She retained her position in the 2013 general election, proving she was a force to reckon with.

In the 2017 poll, however, Ms Mbarire vied for the Embu gubernatorial seat, becoming the first woman to do so.

“I wanted something challenging but lost in the primaries, which were marred by rigging and a lot interference. I was, however, nominated as MP and served as the Deputy Majority Whip until 2020.”

She will be making her second attempt for the gubernatorial job on a United Democratic Alliance (UDA) ticket in the August poll. Emboldened by her campaign slogan Kavinda ni gaka, which means time is now to change our leadership style, have a people oriented government, and have people centred services. The slogan also implies that time has come to give a woman leader a chance to show what the women can do.

Being the youngest candidate in the race, her candidature has generated a lot of interest among the youth.

“I am also banking on the women vote. I have built a strong connection with them and believe they will vote for me. I have seen a lot of excitement by the women.”

Ms Mbarire’s track record is one to envy. She started a women’s bank in Runyenjes Constituency in her term as MP. The Runyenjes Women Trust Fund is one of the best performing village banks in the county, and offers cheap credit facilities to women.

“Our membership has grown to around 7,000 women, both in groups and individuals, with a liquidity base of Sh140 million from Sh4.5 million in 2009.”

Ms Mbarire, then Runyenjes MP, addresses opinion leaders from Kyeni Location in Embu in 2017. For her gubernatorial bid, she is banking on the women and youth vote. 

The legislator is also credited with initiating water projects. “I was doing this in phases. In phase one, I did a major irrigation project in Runyenjes Constituency where more than 2,000 farmers are currently farming throughout the year. It is one of the most successful irrigation projects in Embu County.”

She notes that phase two, which was to build Thuci Water Dam stalled because of challenges caused by government bureaucracy.

“I am confident we will revive it when I win. We will also focus on three other dams that are critical for Embu County to be food sufficient and have their own income generating agri-businesses.”

“My passion is to ensure women have access to clean water to reduce their burden of work at the village level.”

Her other priority areas include revamping the health sector, which she says is in a sorry state.

“I will make sure the health sector is working, health facilities become operational, efficient, available and accessible to all residents of Embu. I will improve services being offered at the level five hospital, the largest in Embu County but facing myriad challenges right from management to corruption, to just lack of basic services and equipment.”

Ms Mbarire, who has been instrumental in steering reforms in the coffee and tea sector, will also focus on value addition of agricultural products.

“I am looking at starting cottage industries to pave way for value addition for our milk, macadamia nuts, avocadoes and honey.”

If elected, she also wants to establish a department within the Ministry of Agriculture to create market linkages for farm produce. “This will help eliminate the middle men who exploit our farmers.  I will also revamp the extension services to make sure farmers have access to the services.”          

For cotton farming, she says she plans to provide inputs to farmers to revamp the sector and “create our own cotton factory in the county.”

The MP has an agenda for young people. “I will make sure the county taps on existing Technical Training Institutes in Runyenjes, Mbeere South and in Manyatta to equip the youth with skills and make them self-reliant. The county will offer them some credit facilities to enable them start their own businesses.”

“At least 30 per cent of all public procurement opportunities in the county will be reserved for youth, women and persons with disabilities. This will ensure a considerable number of marginalized groups are able to win government tenders, which is key to economic empowerment.” 

To achieve this, she says, the county will train women and youth contractors on the basic skills, ensure they have registered companies that can access government tenders, and liaise with banks to offer them credit facilities.

Ms Mbarire describes herself as a result oriented leader who never settles for mediocrity and, therefore, will set targets to the officers in her government to make sure “we achieve our goals within set timelines.”

She believes her management skills and political networks will help her succeed.

“I have been into politics for 20 years and I have created important and useful political networks. I have good friends across the political divide.”

But to succeed even more, Ms Mbarire pledges to operate on an open door policy and incorporate the views of all in the county for her project to succeed.

“Mine will be a people centred government. I promise to do better in terms of engaging the local leadership. As a governor, I will be the glue that brings this people together.

“I will create a forum where we can meet regularly and discuss the issues affecting the county, know what each leader is doing, so that we are able to lobby as a team for other programs and projects at the national level.”

Her focus will be to ensure there is transparency and accountability so that the people of Embu enjoy prudent management of their resources. “I will digitize revenue collection system to ensure local revenue does not end up in people’s pocket.”

She is, however, afraid that development in the county has been a bit skewed in favour of certain areas, but vows to use affirmative action approach so that all areas feel part of the government and its plans.

“I want to ensure the Mbeere community, for instance, has either a CEC or a chief officer in my government. This will give them a voice in the executive arm of government.”

Ms Mbarire says she does not want to be elected for the sake of it, but to be remembered as the best performing governor who delivered on her promises, who managed the county well, and safeguarded the interests of the people and their resources.

To other women seeking elective seats, she advises: “Just be issue driven, sell your manifesto, and let the people know what you stand for. Once they know your agenda, they will support you. Do not play politics the way men do, men are usually crude, rough and sometimes use physical violence in elections. If you are woman do not fall into the trap of playing it the men way. Cut your own niche and run a campaign that befits you as a woman.”

pruning,  in horticulture, the removal or reduction of parts of a plant, tree, or vine that are not requisite to growth or production, are no longer visually pleasing, or are injurious to the health or development of the plant. Pruning is common practice in orchard and vineyard management for the improvement of flowering and fruiting. In home gardening (e.g., rose culture), pruning enhances plant shape and flowering potential; new growth emerges from the bud or buds immediately below the pruning cut. The once-common practice of cutting off a branch so that its base is flush with the limb is now recognized as inadvisable. Instead, the pruning cut should be made just above the collar, or swelling—essentially a protective callus—that surrounds the base of the branch. Ragged bark at the edge of the wound should be carefully trimmed. The application of pruning paint, or dressing, also a once-common practice, is unnecessary, but thin coasts may be applied for cosmetic reasons. Incorrect pruning can cause flower and fruit loss and leave the plant weak and vulnerable to disease or insect damage.

Tree injuries caused by ice, strong winds, lightning, fire, or disease require major repair by a tree surgeon. If left uncorrected, such damage can result in the death of the tree. Common tree surgery procedures include the removal of broken, dead, or diseased branches; cutting back limbs that interfere with traffic, impede power and telephone lines, obstruct views, or mar the shape of a tree; thinning to permit air circulation and secure more light; removal of branches that rub against others to prevent wounding and possible future decay; judicious cutting to compensate for root loss and promote formation of blossoms; and heading back to revitalize an aged tree. The origin of modern tree surgery is attributed to John Davey of Kent, Ohio, who established a landscaping business there in 1880."

plow, also spelled plough,  most important agricultural implement since the beginning of history, used to turn and break up soil, to bury crop residues, and to help control weeds.

The antecedent of the plow is the prehistoric digging stick. The earliest plows were doubtless digging sticks fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing. By Roman times, light, wheelless plows with iron shares (blades) were drawn by oxen; these implements could break up the topsoil of the Mediterranean regions but could not handle the heavier soils of northwestern Europe. The wheeled plow, at first drawn by oxen but later by horses, made possible the northward spread of European agriculture. The 18th-century addition of the moldboard, which turned the furrow slice cut by the plowshare, was an important advance. In the mid-19th century the black prairie soils of the American Midwest challenged the strength of the existing plow, and American mechanic John Deere invented the all-steel one-piece share and moldboard. The three-wheel sulky plow followed and, with the introduction of the gasoline engine, the tractor-drawn plow.

In its simplest form the moldboard plow consists of the share, the broad blade that cuts through the soil; the moldboard, for turning the furrow slice; and the landside, a plate on the opposite side from the moldboard that absorbs the side thrust of the turning action. Horse-drawn moldboard plows, which are no longer commonly used, have a single bottom (share and moldboard), while tractor-drawn plows have from 1 to 14 hydraulically lifted and controlled bottoms staggered in tandem. Listers and middlebusters are double-moldboard plows that leave a furrow by throwing the dirt both ways.

Disk plows usually have three or more individually mounted concave disks that are inclined backward to achieve maximum depth. They are particularly adapted for use in hard, dry soils, shrubby or bushy land, or on rocky land. Disk tillers, also called harrow plows or one-way disk plows, usually consist of a gang of many disks mounted on one axle (see harrow). Used after grain harvest, they usually leave some stubble to help reduce wind erosion and often have seeding equipment. Two-way (reversible) plows have disks or moldboards that can be either opposed, so that one fills the trench made by the other, or set to throw the soil entirely to the right or left.

Rotary plows or tillers (sometimes called rototillers) have curved cutting knives mounted on a horizontal power-driven shaft. The pronged rotary hoe, a plow used chiefly for seedbed and weed control, works well at high speed. Garden sizes cut swaths from about 0.3 to 0.8 metre (1 to 2.5 feet) wide; tractor types, more than 3 metres (10 feet).

Deep tillage implements, used chiefly to break up hardpan and packed soils, include the subsoiler and the chisel plow. The subsoiler must be pulled by a heavy tractor, for its steel-pointed shank is capable of penetrating the subsoil to a depth of nearly one metre (three feet). The chisel plow, or ripper, has several rigid or spring-toothed shanks with double pointed shovels mounted on a transverse bar at intervals of 0.3 to 0.9 metres (one to three feet). Plowing depths vary from shallow to a half metre (1.5 feet)."

plant breeding,  application of genetic principles to produce plants that are more useful to humans. This is accomplished by selecting plants found to be economically or aesthetically desirable, first by controlling the mating of selected individuals, and then by selecting certain individuals among the progeny. Such processes, repeated over many generations, can change the hereditary makeup and value of a plant population far beyond the natural limits of previously existing populations. This article emphasizes the application of genetic principles to the improvement of plants; the biological factors underlying plant breeding are dealt with in the article heredity. For a discussion on transgenic crops, see genetically modified organism.

Plant breeding is an ancient activity, dating to the very beginnings of agriculture. Probably soon after the earliest domestications of cereal grains, humans began to recognize degrees of excellence among the plants in their fields and saved seed from the best for planting new crops. Such tentative selective methods were the forerunners of early plant-breeding procedures.

The results of early plant-breeding procedures were conspicuous. Most present-day varieties are so modified from their wild progenitors that they are unable to survive in nature. Indeed, in some cases, the cultivated forms are so strikingly different from existing wild relatives that it is difficult even to identify their ancestors. These remarkable transformations were accomplished by early plant breeders in a very short time from an evolutionary point of view, and the rate of change was probably greater than for any other evolutionary event.

In the mid-1800s Gregor Mendel outlined the principles of heredity using pea plants and thus provided the necessary framework for scientific plant breeding. As the laws of genetic inheritance were further delineated in the early 20th century, a beginning was made toward applying them to the improvement of plants. One of the major facts that emerged during the short history of scientific breeding is that an enormous wealth of genetic variability exists in the plants of the world and that only a start has been made in tapping its potential.

The plant breeder usually has in mind an ideal plant that combines a maximum number of desirable characteristics. These characteristics may include resistance to diseases and insects; tolerance to heat, soil salinity, or frost; appropriate size, shape, and time to maturity; and many other general and specific traits that contribute to improved adaptation to the environment, ease in growing and handling, greater yield, and better quality. The breeder of horticultural plants must also consider aesthetic appeal. Thus the breeder can rarely focus attention on any one characteristic but must take into account the manifold traits that make the plant more useful in fulfilling the purpose for which it is grown. Plant breeding is an important tool in promoting global food security, and many staple crops have been bred to better withstand extreme weather conditions associated with global warming, such as drought or heat waves.

One of the aims of virtually every breeding project is to increase yield. This can often be brought about by selecting obvious morphological variants. One example is the selection of dwarf, early maturing varieties of rice. These dwarf varieties are sturdy and give a greater yield of grain. Furthermore, their early maturity frees the land quickly, often allowing an additional planting of rice or other crop the same year.

Another way of increasing yield is to develop varieties resistant to diseases and insects. In many cases the development of resistant varieties has been the only practical method of pest control. Perhaps the most important feature of resistant varieties is the stabilizing effect they have on production and hence on steady food supplies. Varieties tolerant to drought, heat, or cold provide the same benefit.

Another common goal of plant breeding is to extend the area of production of a crop species. A good example is the modification of grain sorghum since its introduction to the United States in the 1750s. Of tropical origin, grain sorghum was largely confined to the southern Plains area and the Southwest, but earlier-maturing varieties were developed, and grain sorghum is now an important crop as far north as North Dakota.

Development of crop varieties suitable for mechanized agriculture has become a major goal of plant breeding in recent years. Uniformity of plant characters is very important in mechanized agriculture because field operations are much easier when the individuals of a variety are similar in time of germination, growth rate, size of fruit, and so on. Uniformity in maturity is, of course, essential when crops such as tomatoes and peas are harvested mechanically.

The nutritional quality of plants can be greatly improved by breeding. For example, it is possible to breed varieties of corn (maize) much higher in lysine than previously existing varieties. Breeding high-lysine maize varieties for those areas of the world where maize is the major source of this nutritionally essential amino acid has become a major goal in plant breeding. This “biofortification” of food crops, a term which also includes genetic modification, has been shown to improve nutrition and is especially useful in developing areas where nutritional deficiencies are common and medical infrastructure may be lacking.

In breeding ornamental plants, attention is paid to such factors as longer blooming periods, improved keeping qualities of flowers, general thriftiness, and other features that contribute to usefulness and aesthetic appeal. Novelty itself is often a virtue in ornamentals, and the spectacular, even the bizarre, is often sought."

irrigation,  in agriculture. the artificial application of water to land. Some land requires irrigation before it is possible to use it for any agricultural production. In other places, irrigation is primarily a means to supplement rainfall and serves to increase production. Some land, of course, does not need any irrigation. Although the practice may be used for nonagricultural purposes to improve the environment, this article is limited to irrigation in agricultural contexts.

Irrigation and drainage improvements are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Often both may be required together to assure sustained high-level production of crops. For a discussion of the role of drainage practices in agriculture, see drainage.

The first consideration in planning an irrigation project is developing a water supply. Water supplies may be classified as surface or subsurface. Though both surface and subsurface water come from precipitation such as rain or snow, it is far more difficult to determine the origin of subsurface water.

In planning a surface water supply, extensive studies must be made of the flow in the stream or river that will be used. If the streamflow has been measured regularly over a long period, including times of drought and flood, the studies are greatly simplified. From streamflow data, determinations can be made of the minimum, maximum, average daily, and average monthly flows; the size of dams, spillways, and the downstream channel; and the seasonal and carryover storage needed. If adequate streamflow data are not available, the streamflow may be estimated from rain and snow data or from flow data from nearby streams that have similar climatic and physiographic conditions.

The quality, as well as the quantity, of surface water is a factor. The two most important considerations are the amount of silt carried and the kind and amount of salts dissolved in the water. If the silt content is high, sediment will be deposited in the reservoir, increasing maintenance costs and decreasing useful life periods. If the salt concentration is high, it may damage crops or accumulate in the soil and eventually render it unproductive.

Subsurface sources of water must be as carefully investigated as surface sources. In general, less is known about subsurface supplies of water than about surface supplies, so, therefore, subsurface supplies are harder to investigate. Engineers planning a project need to know the extent of the basic geological source of water (the aquifer), as well as the amount the water level is lowered by pumping and the rate of recharge of the aquifer. Often the only way for the engineer to obtain these data reliably is to drill test wells and make on-site measurements. Ideally, a project is planned so as not to use more subsurface water than is recharged. Otherwise, the water is said to be “mined,” meaning that it is being used up as a natural resource and its use is considered unsustainable.

Two sources of water not often thought of by the layperson are dew and sewage or wastewater. In certain parts of the world, Israel and part of Australia, for example, where atmospheric conditions are right, sufficient dew may be trapped at night to provide water for irrigation. Elsewhere the supply of wastewater from some industries and municipalities is sufficient to irrigate relatively small acreages. Recently, due to greater emphasis on purer water in streams, there has been increased interest in this latter practice.

In some countries (Egypt for example) sewage is a valuable source of water. In others, such as the United States, irrigation is looked upon as a means of disposing of sewer water as a final step in the wastewater treatment process. Unless the water contains unusual chemical salts, such as sodium, it is generally of satisfactory quality for agricultural irrigation. Where the practice is used primarily as a means of disposal, large areas are involved and the choice of crop is critical. Usually only grass or trees can withstand the year-round applications.

Before a water supply can be assured, the right to it must be determined. Countries and states have widely varying laws and customs that determine ownership of water. If the development of a water supply is for a single purpose, then the determination of ownership may be relatively simple; but if the development is multipurpose, as most modern developments are, ownership may be difficult to determine, and agreements must be worked out among countries, states, municipalities, and private owners.

The area that can be irrigated by a water supply depends on the weather, the type of crop grown, and the soil. Numerous methods have been developed to evaluate these factors and predict average annual volume of rainfall needed. Some representative annual amounts of rainfall needed for cropland in the western United States are 305 to 760 mm (12 to 30 inches) for cereal grains and 610 to 1,525 mm (24 to 60 inches) for forage. In the Near East, cotton needs about 915 mm (36 inches), whereas rice may require two to three times that amount. In humid regions of the United States, where irrigation supplements rainfall, grain crops may require 150 to 230 mm (6 to 9 inches) of water. In addition to satisfying the needs of the crop, allowances must be made for water lost directly to evaporation and during transport to the fields.

The type of transport system used for an irrigation project is often determined by the source of the water supply. If a surface water supply is used, a large canal or pipeline system is usually required to carry the water to the farms because the reservoir is likely to be distant from the point of use. If subsurface water drawn from wells is used, a much smaller transport system is needed, though canals or pipelines may be used. The transport system will depend as far as possible on gravity flow, supplemented if necessary by pumping. From the mains, water flows into branches, or laterals, and finally to distributors that serve groups of farms. Many auxiliary structures are required, including weirs (flow-diversion dams), sluices, and other types of dams. Canals are normally lined with concrete to prevent seepage losses, control weed growth, eliminate erosion hazards, and reduce maintenance. The most common type of concrete canal construction is by slip forming. In this type of construction, the canal is excavated to the exact cross section desired and the concrete placed on the earth sides and bottom.

Pipelines may be constructed of many types of material. The larger lines are usually concrete whereas laterals may be concrete, cement–asbestos, rigid plastic, aluminum, or steel. Although pipelines are more costly than open conduits, they do not require land after construction, suffer little evaporation loss, and are not troubled by algae growth.

After water reaches the farm it may be applied by surface, subsurface, or sprinkler irrigation methods. Surface irrigation is normally used only where the land has been graded so that uniform slopes exist. Land grading is not necessary for other methods. Each method includes several variations, only the more common of which are considered here.

Surface irrigation systems are usually classed as either flood or furrow systems. In the flood system, water is applied at the edge of a field and allowed to move over the entire surface to the opposite side of the field. Grain and forage crops are quite often irrigated by flood techniques. The furrow system is used for row crops such as corn (maize), cotton, sugar beets, and potatoes. Furrows are plowed between crop rows and the water is run in the furrows. In either type of surface irrigation systems, waste-water ditches at the lower edge of the fields permit excess water to be removed for use elsewhere and to prevent waterlogging.

Subirrigation is a less common method. An impermeable layer must be located below, but near, the root zone of the crop so that water is trapped in the root zone. If this condition exists, water is applied to the soil through tile drains or ditches.

Sprinklers have been used increasingly to irrigate agricultural land. Little or no preparation is needed, application rates can be controlled, and the system may be used for frost protection and the application of chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Sprinklers range from those that apply water in the form of a mist to those that apply an inch or more per hour."

gardening,  the laying out and care of a plot of ground devoted partially or wholly to the growing of plants such as flowers, herbs, or vegetables.

Gardening can be considered both as an art, concerned with arranging plants harmoniously in their surroundings, and as a science, encompassing the principles and techniques of plant cultivation. Because plants are often grown in conditions markedly different from those of their natural environment, it is necessary to apply to their cultivation techniques derived from plant physiology, chemistry, and botany, modified by the experience of the planter. The basic principles involved in growing plants are the same in all parts of the world, but the practice naturally needs much adaptation to local conditions.

For the main history of garden development, see the article garden and landscape design: Historical development.

Gardening in its ornamental sense needs a certain level of civilization before it can flourish. Wherever that level has been attained, in all parts of the world and at all periods, people have made efforts to shape their environment into an attractive display. The instinct and even enthusiasm for gardening thus appear to arise from some primitive response to nature, engendering a wish to produce growth and harmony in a creative partnership with it.

It is possible to be merely an admiring spectator of gardens. However, most people who cultivate a domestic plot also derive satisfaction from involvement in the processes of tending plants. They find that the necessary attention to the seasonal changes, and to the myriad small “events” in any shrubbery or herbaceous border, improves their understanding and appreciation of gardens in general.

A phenomenal upsurge of interest in gardening began in Western countries after World War II. A lawn with flower beds and perhaps a vegetable patch has become a sought-after advantage to home ownership. The increased interest produced an unprecedented expansion of business among horticultural suppliers, nurseries, garden centres, and seedsmen. Books, journals, and newspaper columns on garden practice have found an eager readership, while television and radio programs on the subject have achieved a dedicated following.

Several reasons for this expansion suggest themselves. Increased leisure in the industrial nations gives more people the opportunity to enjoy this relaxing pursuit. The increased public appetite for self-sufficiency in basic skills also encourages people to take up the spade. In the kitchen, the homegrown potato or ear of sweet corn rewards the gardener with a sense of achievement, as well as with flavour superior to that of store-bought produce. An increased awareness of threats to the natural environment and the drabness of many inner cities stir some people to cultivate the greenery and colour around their own doorsteps. The bustle of 20th-century life leads more individuals to rediscover the age-old tranquillity of gardens.

The attractions of gardening are many and various and, to a degree perhaps unique among the arts and crafts, may be experienced by any age group and at all levels of ambition. At its most elemental, but not least valuable, the gardening experience begins with the child’s wonder that a packet of seeds will produce a charming festival of colour. At the adult level, it can be as simple as helping to raise a good and edible carrot, and it can give rise to almost parental pride. At higher levels of appreciation, it involves an understanding of the complexity of the gardening process, equivalent to a chess game with nature, because the variables are so many.

The gardening experience may involve visiting some of the world’s great gardens at different seasons to see the relation of individual groups of plants, trees, and shrubs to the whole design; to study the positioning of plants in terms of their colour, texture, and weight of leaf or blossom; and to appreciate the use of special features such as ponds or watercourses, pavilions, or rockeries. Garden visiting on an international scale provides an opportunity to understand the broad cultural influences, as well as the variations in climate and soil, that have resulted in so many different approaches to garden making.

The appeal of gardening is thus multifaceted and wide in range. The garden is often the only place where someone without special training can exercise creative impulses as designer, artist, technician, and scientific observer. In addition, many find it a relaxing and therapeutic pursuit. It is not surprising that the garden, accorded respect as a part of nature and a place of contemplation, holds a special place in the spiritual life of many.

Practical and spiritual aspects of gardening are shown in an impressive body of literature. In Western countries manuals of instruction date to classical Greece and Rome. Images of plants and gardens are profuse in the works of the major poets, from Virgil to Shakespeare, and on to some of the moderns.

Another of gardening’s attractions is that up to a certain level it is a simple craft to learn. The beginner can produce pleasing results without the exacting studies and practice required by, for example, painting or music. Gardens are also forgiving to the inexperienced to a certain degree. Nature’s exuberance will cover up minor errors or short periods of neglect, so gardening is an art practiced in a relatively nonjudgmental atmosphere. While tolerant in many respects, nature does, however, present firm reminders that all gardening takes place within a framework of natural law; and one important aspect of the study of the craft is to learn which of these primal rules are imperatives and which may be stretched.

Large areas of gardening development and mastery have concentrated on persuading plants to achieve what they would not have done if left in the wild and therefore “natural” state. Gardens at all times have been created through a good deal of control and what might be called interference. The gardener attends to a number of basic processes: combating weeds and pests; using space to allay the competition between plants; attending to feeding, watering, and pruning; and conditioning the soil. Above this fundamental level, the gardener assesses and accommodates the unique complex of temperature, wind, rainfall, sunlight, and shade found within his own garden boundaries. A major part of the fascination of gardening is that in problems and potential no one garden is quite like another; and it is in finding the most imaginative solutions to challenges that the gardener demonstrates artistry and finds the subtler levels of satisfaction.

Different aesthetics require different balances between controlling nature and cooperating with its requirements. The degree of control depends on the gardener’s objective, the theme and identity he is aiming to create. For example, the English wild woodland style of gardening in the mid-19th century dispensed with controls after planting, and any interference, such as pruning, would have been misplaced. At the other extreme is the Japanese dry-landscape garden, beautifully composed of rock and raked pebbles. The artistic control in this type of garden is so firm and refined that the intrusion of a single “natural” weed would spoil the effect."

fish processing,  preparation of seafood and freshwater fish for human consumption.

The word fish is commonly used to describe all forms of edible finfish, mollusks (e.g., clams and oysters), and crustaceans (e.g., crabs and lobsters) that inhabit an aquatic environment. Fish from the marine and freshwater bodies of the world have been a major source of food for humankind since before recorded history. Harvesting wild fish from fresh and marine waters and raising cultured fish in ponds were practices of ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and other Mediterranean peoples. Rudimentary processing techniques such as sun-drying, salting, and smoking were used by these ancient groups to stabilize the fish supply. Modern methods of processing and preservation have encouraged the consumption of many species of fish that are popular throughout the world.

The majority of edible fish products are derived from the skeletal muscles (flesh), which represent more than 50 percent of the total body mass of these animals. The skeletal muscles of fish differ from those of mammals and birds in that they are largely composed of stacks of short bundles of muscle fibres called myomeres. The myomeres are separated by thin horizontal (myosepta) and vertical (myocommata) layers of connective tissue. The unique structure and thin connective tissue sheaths of fish muscle give the meat its characteristic soft, flaky texture.

The skeletal muscles of fish are composed mostly of white, fast-twitch fibres. The high percentage of white fibres allows fish to swim with sudden, rapid movements and gives the meat its white colour. These fibres primarily metabolize glucose, a simple sugar released from muscle glycogen stores, for energy production through anaerobic (i.e., in the absence of oxygen) glycolysis. Therefore, white fibres contain relatively little myoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein that provides the red colour of muscles in other animals.

The composition of fish may vary considerably—especially in their fat content—during certain growth periods and annual spawning or migration periods. In addition, the composition of fish bred in captivity (i.e., aquaculture fish) may vary according to their artificial diet. The table shows the nutrient composition of several types of fish.

Fish are an excellent source of high-quality protein. Mollusks are generally lower in protein compared with finfish and crustaceans because of their high water content. The proteins found in fish are essentially the same as those found in the meat derived from other animals—that is, the sarcoplasmic proteins (e.g., enzymes and myoglobin), the contractile or myofibrillar proteins (e.g., actin and myosin), and the connective tissue proteins (i.e., collagen)."

fertilizer,  natural or artificial substance containing the chemical elements that improve growth and productiveness of plants. Fertilizers enhance the natural fertility of the soil or replace chemical elements taken from the soil by previous crops.

Soil fertility is the quality of a soil that enables it to provide compounds in adequate amounts and proper balance to promote growth of plants when other factors (such as light, moisture, temperature, and soil structure) are favourable. Where fertility of the soil is not good, natural or manufactured materials may be added to supply the needed plant nutrients. These are called fertilizers, although the term is generally applied to largely inorganic materials other than lime or gypsum.

In total, plants need at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Plants obtain carbon from the atmosphere and hydrogen and oxygen from water; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although plants contain sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of silicon and aluminum.

Overall chemical analyses indicate that the total supply of nutrients in soils is usually high in comparison with the requirements of crop plants. Much of this potential supply, however, is bound tightly in forms that are not released to crops fast enough to give satisfactory growth. Because of this, the farmer is interested in measuring the available nutrient supply as contrasted to the total nutrient supply. When the available supply of a given nutrient becomes depleted, its absence becomes a limiting factor in plant growth. Excessive quantities of some nutrients may cause a decrease in yield, however.

Determination of a crop’s nutrient needs is an essential aspect of fertilizer technology. The appearance of a growing crop may indicate a need for fertilizer, though in some plants the need for more or different nutrients may not be easily observable. If such a problem exists, its nature must be diagnosed, the degree of deficiency must be determined, and the amount and kind of fertilizer needed for a given yield must be found. There is no substitute for detailed examination of plants and soil conditions in the field, followed by simple fertilizer tests, quick tests of plant tissues, and analysis of soils and plants.

Sometimes plants show symptoms of poor nutrition. Chlorosis (general yellow or pale green colour), for example, indicates lack of sulfur and nitrogen. Iron deficiency produces white or pale yellow tissue. Symptoms can be misinterpreted, however. Plant disease can produce appearances resembling mineral deficiency, as can various organisms. Drought or improper cultivation or fertilizer application each may create deficiency symptoms.

After field diagnosis, the conclusions may be confirmed by experiments in a greenhouse or by making strip tests in the field. In strip tests, the fertilizer elements suspected of being deficient are added, singly or in combination, and the resulting plant growth observed. Next it is necessary to determine the extent of the deficiency.

An experiment in the field can be conducted by adding nutrients to the crop at various rates. The resulting response of yield in relation to amounts of nutrients supplied will indicate the supplying power of the unfertilized soil in terms of bushels or tons of produce. If the increase in yield is large, this practice will show that the soil has too little of a given nutrient. Such field experiments may not be practical, because they can cost too much in time and money. Soil-testing laboratories are available in most areas; they conduct chemical soil tests to estimate the availability of nutrients. Commercial soil-testing kits give results that may be very inaccurate, depending on techniques and interpretation. Actually, the most accurate system consists of laboratory analysis of the nutrient content of plant parts, such as the leaf. The results, when correlated with yield response to fertilizer application in field experiments, can give the best estimate of deficiency. Further development of remote sensing techniques, such as infrared photography, are under study and may ultimately become the most valuable technique for such estimates.

The practical goal is to determine how much nutrient material to add. Since the farmer wants to know how much profit to expect when buying fertilizer, the tests are interpreted as an estimation of increased crop production that will result from nutrient additions. The cost of nutrients must be balanced against the value of the crop or even against alternative procedures, such as investing the money in something else with a greater potential return. The law of diminishing returns is well exemplified in fertilizer technology. Past a certain point, equal inputs of chemicals produce less and less yield increase. The goal of the farmer is to use fertilizer in such a way that the most profitable application rate is employed. Ideal fertilizer application also minimizes excess and ill-timed application, which is not only wasteful for the farmer but also harmful to nearby waterways. Unfortunately, water pollution from fertilizer runoff, which has a sphere of impact that extends far beyond the farmer and the fields, is a negative externality that is not accounted for in the costs and prices of the unregulated market.

Fertilizers can aid in making profitable changes in farming. Operators can reduce costs per unit of production and increase the margin of return over total cost by increasing rates of application of fertilizer on principal cash and feed crops. They are then in a position to invest in soil conservation and other improvements that are needed when shifting acreage from surplus crops to other uses.

Modern chemical fertilizers include one or more of the three elements that are most important in plant nutrition: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Of secondary importance are the elements sulfur, magnesium, and calcium.

Most nitrogen fertilizers are obtained from synthetic ammonia; this chemical compound (NH3) is used either as a gas or in a water solution, or it is converted into salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium phosphate, but packinghouse wastes, treated garbage, sewage, and manure are also common sources of it. Because its nitrogen content is high and is readily converted to ammonia in the soil, urea is one of the most concentrated nitrogenous fertilizers. An inexpensive compound, it is incorporated in mixed fertilizers as well as being applied alone to the soil or sprayed on foliage. With formaldehyde it gives methylene-urea fertilizers, which release nitrogen slowly, continuously, and uniformly, a full year’s supply being applied at one time.

Phosphorus fertilizers include calcium phosphate derived from phosphate rock or bones. The more soluble superphosphate and triple superphosphate preparations are obtained by the treatment of calcium phosphate with sulfuric and phosphoric acid, respectively. Potassium fertilizers, namely potassium chloride and potassium sulfate, are mined from potash deposits. Of commercially produced potassium compounds, almost 95 percent of them are used in agriculture as fertilizer.

Mixed fertilizers contain more than one of the three major nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Fertilizer grade is a conventional expression that indicates the percentage of plant nutrients in a fertilizer; thus, a 10–20–10 grade contains 10 percent nitrogen, 20 percent phosphoric oxide, and 10 percent potash. Mixed fertilizers can be formulated in hundreds of ways.

The use of manure and compost as fertilizers is probably almost as old as agriculture. Many traditional farming systems still rely on these sustainable fertilizers, and their use is vital to the productivity of certified organic farms, in which synthetic fertilizers are not permitted.

Among sources of organic matter and plant nutrients, farm manure has been of major importance. Manure is understood to mean the refuse from stables and barnyards, including both excreta and straw or other bedding material. Large amounts of manure are produced by livestock; such manure has value in maintaining and improving soil because of the plant nutrients, humus, and organic substances contained in it.

Due to the potential for harbouring human pathogens, the USDA National Organic Standards mandate that raw manure must be applied no later than 90 or 120 days before harvest, depending on whether the harvested part of the crop is in contact with the ground. Composted manure that has been turned five times in 15 days and reached temperatures between 55 and 77.2 °C (131 and 171 °F) has no restrictions on application times. As manure must be managed carefully in order to derive the most benefit from it, some farmers may be unwilling to expend the necessary time and effort. Manure must be carefully stored to minimize loss of nutrients, particularly nitrogen. It must be applied to the right kind of crop at the proper time. Also, additional fertilizer may be needed, such as phosphoric oxide, in order to gain full value of the nitrogen and potash that are contained in manure.

Manure is fertilizer graded as approximately 0.5–0.25–0.5 (percentages of nitrogen, phosphoric oxide, and potash), with at least two-thirds of the nitrogen in slow-acting forms. Given that these nutrients are mostly in an unmineralized form that cannot be taken up by plants, soil microbes are needed to break down organic matter and transform nutrients into a bioavailable “mineralized” state. In comparison, synthetic fertilizers are already in mineralized form and can be taken up by plants directly. On properly tilled soils, the returns from synthetic fertilizer usually will be greater than from an equivalent amount of manure. However, manure provides many indirect benefits. It supplies humus, which improves the soil’s physical character by increasing its capacity to absorb and store water, by enhancement of aeration, and by favouring the activities of lower organisms. Manure incorporated into the topsoil will help prevent erosion from heavy rain and slow down evaporation of water from the surface. In effect, the value of manure as a mulching material may be greater than is its value as a source of essential plant nutrients.

In reasonably humid areas the practice of green manuring can improve yield and soil qualities. A green manure crop is grown and plowed under for its beneficial effects, although during its growth it may be grazed. These green manure crops are usually annuals, either grasses or legumes, whose roots bear nodule bacteria capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Among the advantages of green manure crops are the addition of nitrogen to the soil, an increase in general fertility, a reduction of erosion, an improvement of physical condition, and a reduction of nutrient loss from leaching. Disadvantages include the chance of not obtaining satisfactory growth; the possibility that the cost of growing the manure crop may exceed the cost of applying commercial nitrogen; possible increases in disease, insect pests, and nematodes (parasitic worms); and possible exhaustion of soil moisture by the crop.

Green manure crops are usually planted in the fall and turned under in the spring before the summer crop is sown. Their value as a source of nitrogen, particularly that of the legumes, is unquestioned for certain crops such as potatoes, cotton, and corn (maize); for other crops, such as peanuts (groundnuts; themselves legumes), the practice is questionable.

Compost is used in agriculture and gardening primarily as a soil amendment rather than as fertilizer, because it has a low content of plant nutrients. It may be incorporated into the soil or mulched on the surface. Heavy rates of application are common.

Compost is basically a mass of rotted organic matter made from waste plant residues. Addition of nitrogen during decomposition is usually advisable. The result is a crumbly material that when added to soil does not compete with the crop for nitrogen. When properly prepared, it is free of obnoxious odours. Composts commonly contain about 2 percent nitrogen, 0.5 to 1 percent phosphorus, and about 2 percent potassium. The nitrogen of compost becomes available slowly and never approaches that available from inorganic sources. This slow release of nitrogen reduces leaching and extends availability over the whole growing season. Composts are essentially fertilizers with low nutrient content, which explains why large amounts are applied. The maximum benefits of composts on soil structure (better aggregation, pore spacing, and water storage) and on crop yield usually occur after several years of use.

In practical farming, the use of composted plant residues must be compared with the use of fresh residues. More beneficial soil effects usually accrue with less labour by simply turning under fresh residues; also, since one-half the organic matter is lost in composting, fresh residues applied at the same rate will cover twice the area that composted residues would cover. In areas where commercial fertilizers are expensive, labour is cheap, and implements are simple, however, composting meets the need and is a logical practice.

Sewage sludge, the solid material remaining from the treatment of sewage, is not permitted in certified organic farming, though it is used in other, nonorganic settings. After suitable processing, it is sold as fertilizer and as a soil amendment for use on lawns, in parks, and on golf courses. Use of human biosolids in agriculture is controversial, as there are concerns that even treated sewage may harbour harmful bacteria, viruses, pharmaceutical residues, and heavy metals.

Liming to reduce soil acidity is practiced extensively in humid areas where rainfall leaches calcium and magnesium from the soil, thus creating an acid condition. Calcium and magnesium are major plant nutrients supplied by liming materials. Ground limestone is widely used for this purpose; its active agent, calcium carbonate, reacts with the soil to reduce its acidity. The calcium is then available for plant use. The typical limestones, especially dolomitic, contain magnesium carbonate as well, thus also supplying magnesium to the plant.

Marl and chalk are soft impure forms of limestone and are sometimes used as liming materials, as are oyster shells. Calcium sulfate (gypsum) and calcium chloride, however, are unsuitable for liming, for, although their calcium is readily soluble, they leave behind a residue that is harmful. Organic standards by the European Union and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restrict certain liming agents; burnt lime and hydrated lime are not permitted for certified organic farms in the U.S., for example.

Lime is applied by mixing it uniformly with the surface layer of the soil. It may be applied at any time of the year on land plowed for spring crops or winter grain or on permanent pasture. After application, plowing, disking, or harrowing will mix it with the soil. Such tillage is usually necessary, because calcium migrates slowly downward in most soils. Lime is usually applied by trucks specially equipped and owned by custom operators.

Fertilizers may be added to soil in solid, liquid, or gaseous forms, the choice depending on many factors. Generally, the farmer tries to obtain satisfactory yield at minimum cost in money and labour.

Manure can be applied as a liquid or a solid. When accumulated as a liquid from livestock areas, it may be stored in tanks until needed and then pumped into a distributing machine or into a sprinkler irrigation system. The method reduces labour, but the noxious odours are objectionable. The solid-manure spreader, which can also be used for compost, conveys the material to the field, shreds it, and spreads it uniformly over the land. The process can be carried out during convenient times, including winter, but rarely when the crop is growing.

Application of granulated or pelleted solid fertilizer has been aided by improved equipment design. Such devices, depending on design, can deposit fertilizer at the time of planting, side-dress a growing crop, or broadcast the material. Solid-fertilizer distributors have a wide hopper with holes in the bottom; distribution is effected by various means, such as rollers, agitators, or endless chains traversing the hopper bottom. Broadcast distributors have a tub-shaped hopper from which the material falls onto revolving disks that distribute it in a broad swath. Fertilizer attachments are available for most tractor-mounted planters and cultivators and for grain drills and some types of plows. They deposit fertilizer with the seed when planted, without damage to the seed, yet the nutrient is readily available during early growth. Placement of the fertilizer varies according to the types of crops; some crops require banding above the seed, while others are more successful when the fertilizer band is below the seed.

The use of liquid and ammonia fertilizers is growing, particularly of anhydrous ammonia, which is handled as a liquid under pressure but changes to gas when released to atmospheric pressure. Anhydrous ammonia, however, is highly corrosive, inflammable, and rather dangerous if not handled properly; thus, application equipment is specialized. Typically, the applicator is a chisel-shaped blade with a pipe mounted on its rear side to conduct the ammonia 13 to 15 cm (5 to 6 inches) below the soil surface. Pipes are fed from a pressure tank mounted above. Mixed liquid fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium may be applied directly to the soil surface or as a foliar spray by field sprayers where close-growing crops are raised. Large areas can be covered rapidly by use of aircraft, which can distribute both liquid and dry fertilizer."

feed, also called animal feed,  food grown or developed for livestock and poultry. Modern feeds are produced by carefully selecting and blending ingredients to provide highly nutritional diets that both maintain the health of the animals and increase the quality of such end products as meat, milk, or eggs. Ongoing improvements in animal diets have resulted from research, experimentation, and chemical analysis by agricultural scientists.

Animals in general require the same nutrients as humans. Some feeds, such as pasture grasses, hay and silage crops, and certain cereal grains, are grown specifically for animals. Other feeds, such as sugar beet pulp, brewers’ grains, and pineapple bran, are by-products that remain after a food crop has been processed for human use. Surplus food crops, such as wheat, other cereals, fruits, vegetables, and roots, may also be fed to animals.

History does not record when dried roughage or other stored feeds were first given to animals. Most early records refer to nomadic peoples who, with their herds and flocks, followed the natural feed supplies. When animals were domesticated and used for work in crop production, some of the residues were doubtless fed to them.

The first scientific effort to evaluate feeds for animals on a comparative basis was probably made in 1809 by the German agriculturist Albrecht von Thaer, who developed “hay values” as measures of the nutritive value of feeds. Tables of the value of feeds and of the requirements of animals in Germany followed and were later used in other countries.

Preservation of green forages such as beet leaves and corn (maize) plants by packing them in pits in the earth has long been practiced in northern Europe. The idea of making silage as a means of preserving and utilizing more of the corn plant was gradually developed in Europe and was taken from France to the United States in the 1870s. When the mature, dried corn plant was fed to cattle in the winter, much of the coarse stem was wasted, but when it was chopped and ensiled (made into silage), everything was eaten. During the 20th century, concrete bunker silos for storage of silage became a common sight in many rural areas worldwide.

The basic nutrients that animals require for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and good health include carbohydrates, protein, fat, minerals, vitamins, and water. The energy needed for growth and activity is derived primarily from carbohydrates and fats. Protein will also supply energy, particularly if carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate or if protein intake exceeds the needs of the body.

Animals need a source of energy to sustain life processes within the body and for muscular activity. When the energy intake of an animal exceeds its requirements, the surplus is stored as body fat, which can be utilized later as a source of energy if less food becomes available.

For immature animals, protein is also needed for growth of the muscles and other parts of the body. Since milk, eggs, and wool contain much protein, additional amounts are needed in the feed of animals producing these. All animals require a small amount of protein for maintenance—i.e., the daily repair of muscles, internal organs, and other body tissues.

Proteins are composed of more than 20 different amino acids, which are liberated during digestion. Animals with a simple single stomach (monogastric), including humans, monkeys, swine, poultry, rabbits, and mink, require correct amounts of the following 10 essential amino acids daily: arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. In addition to these, poultry need glycine and glutamic acid for growth. Cystine can replace up to half of the methionine requirement, and tyrosine can replace up to half of the phenyalanine requirement. High-quality protein, such as that supplied by eggs, milk, fish meal, meat by-products, and soybean meal, contains high concentrations of the essential amino acids in the proper balance for their full utilization. Poor-quality protein, such as that in most grains, including corn, barley, and sorghum, contains too little of one or more essential amino acids. Feeds having poor-quality proteins are useful when blended with other feeds that restore the balance in essential amino acids.

A protein source’s amino acid profile is of secondary importance to ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and the other animals that have four stomachs, because the bacteria that aid in the digestion of food in the rumen (first stomach) use simple nitrogen compounds to build proteins in their cells. Further on in the digestive tract, the animals digest the bacteria. By this indirect means, ruminants produce high-quality protein from a food that might originally have contained poor protein or from urea (a nitrogen compound). Very young ruminants, such as calves, lambs, and kids, however, need good-quality protein until the rumen develops sufficiently for this bacterial process to become established.

Most animals get energy from carbohydrates and fats, which are oxidized in the body. These yield heat, which maintains body temperature, furnishes energy for growth and muscle activity, and sustains vital functions. Animals need much more energy (and more total feed) for growth, work, or milk production than for simple maintenance.

Simple carbohydrates such as sugars and starches are readily digested by all animals. The complex carbohydrates (cellulose, hemicelluloses) that make up the fibrous stems of plants are broken down by bacterial and protozoal action in the rumen of cattle and sheep or in the cecum of rabbits and horses. Such complex carbohydrates cannot be digested by humans or, to any appreciable extent, by dogs, cats, birds, or laboratory animals. Thus, ruminants and some herbivorous animals obtain much more of the energy-giving nutrients from the carbohydrates of plants than do monogastric carnivores and omnivores, for which fibrous materials have little or no energy value.

Fat in feeds has a high nutritive value because it is easily digested and because it supplies about two and one-quarter times as much energy as an equal weight of starch or sugar. While fat has a high nutritive value, it can be replaced by an equivalent amount of digestible carbohydrates in the feed, except for small amounts of essential fatty acids. Very small amounts of the unsaturated fatty acid linoleic, contained in some fats, are necessary for growth and health. Animal feeds typically supply ample amounts of this acid unless it has been removed by processing."

dry farming, also called Dryland Farming,  the cultivation of crops without irrigation in regions of limited moisture, typically less than 20 inches (50 centimetres) of precipitation annually. Dry farming depends upon efficient storage of the limited moisture in the soil and the selection of crops and growing methods that make the best use of this moisture. Tilling the land shortly after harvest and keeping it free from weeds are typical methods, but in certain latitudes stubble is left in the fields after harvest to trap snow. Moisture control during crop growing consists largely of destruction of weeds and prevention of runoff. The ideal soil surface is free of weeds but has enough clods or dead vegetable matter to hinder runoff and prevent erosion.

Crops adapted to dry farming may be either drought resistant or drought evasive. Drought-resistant crops, such as sorghum, are able to reduce transpiration (emission of moisture) and may nearly cease growing during periods of moisture shortage, resuming growth when conditions again become favourable. Drought-evasive crops achieve their main growth during times of year when heat and drought conditions are not severe. Crops adapted to dry farming are usually smaller and quicker to mature than those grown under more humid conditions and are usually allotted more space. "

drainage,  in agriculture, the artificial removal of water from land. Drainage is employed in the reclamation of wetlands, in the prevention of erosion, and as a concomitant of irrigation in the agriculture of arid regions. Drainage can remove excess water from an area before it enters the soil, and thus it prevents leaching of nutrients and standing pools of water on the surface and can permit early spring planting. After excess water enters the soil, its removal is an expensive and specialized undertaking that is not directly connected with irrigation, although it sometimes may be necessary for irrigated land.

Irrigation and drainage improvements are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Often both may be required together to assure sustained high-level production of crops. Drainage construction can be used to prepare the land for surface irrigation, thus serving two purposes by one earthmoving operation. For a discussion of the role of irrigation practices in agriculture, see irrigation.

Drainage is an ancient practice, but apparently until recent times it was regarded as less important than irrigation. The first drains were most likely ditches for channeling floodwaters back to the rivers. The addition of linings of less porous materials greatly improved drainage efficiency. The most significant 20th-century development in drainage technology was the application of land-grading techniques to facilitate uniform runoff.

The planning and design of modern drainage systems is not an exact science. Although there have been many advances in soil and crop science, techniques have not been developed for combining the basic principles involved into precise designs. One of the primary reasons for difficulty in applying known theory is the capricious variability of the many factors that affect a drainage system, in contrast to the idealized settings required to develop a theory. Factors determining the most efficient drainage system design for a particular property include soil type, land configuration, amount and pattern of rainfall, and types of crops to be grown. Soils of high sand or silt content are generally suited to subsurface drainage, while soils of high clay content generally require surface systems.

The most important factor is the type of soil, which determines whether water will move through rapidly enough to use subsurface drainage. Soils that have a high percentage of sand- and silt-size particles and a low percentage of clay-size particles usually will transmit water rapidly enough to make subsurface drainage feasible. Soils that are high in clay-size particles usually cannot be drained by subsurface improvements. It is essential to consider soil properties to a depth of 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet), because the layer in the soil that transmits water the slowest controls the design, and subsurface improvements may be installed to these depths.

The topography or slope of the land is also important. In many cases, land in need of drainage is so flat that a contour map showing elevations 30 cm (12 inches) or 15 cm (6 inches) apart is used to identify trouble spots and possible outlets for drainage water. Often an outlet can be developed only by collective community action. The rainfall patterns, the crops to be grown, and the normal height of the water table also are considered. If heavy rainfall is not probable during critical stages of crop growth, less extensive drainage improvements may suffice. The capacity of the system is governed in part by the growth pattern of the crop, its planting date, critical stages of growth, tolerance of excess water, harvest date, and value.

In some areas the normal water level in the soil is high, in others low; this variable is always investigated before a drainage system is planned.

Drainage systems may be divided into two categories: surface and subsurface. Each has several components with similar functions but different names. At the lower, or disposal, end of either system is an outlet. In order of decreasing size, the components of a surface system are the main collection ditch, field ditch, and field drain, and the components of a subsurface system are the main, submain, and lateral conduits from the submain. The outlet is the point of disposal of water from the system; the main carries water to the outlet; the submain or field ditch collects water from a number of smaller units and carries it to the main; and the lateral or field drain, the smallest unit of the system, removes the water from the soil.

The outlet for a drainage system may be a natural stream or river or a large constructed ditch. A constructed ditch usually is trapezoidal in section with side banks flat enough to be stable. Grass may be grown on the banks, which are kept clear of trees and brush that would interfere with the flow of water.

The field drains vary in configuration according to topography, parallel drains being indicated for uniform surfaces and site-specific ones for areas of uneven accumulation. A surface drainage system removes water from the surface of the soil and to approximately the bottom of the field ditches. A surface system is the only means for drainage improvement on soils that absorb or transmit water slowly. Individual surface drains also are used to supplement subsurface systems by removing water from ponded areas.

The field drains of a surface system may be arranged in many patterns. Probably the two most widely used are parallel drains and random drains. Parallel drains are channels running parallel to one another at a uniform spacing of a few to several hundred metres apart, depending on the soil and the slope of the land. Random drains are channels that run to any low areas in the field. The parallel system provides uniform drainage, whereas the random system drains only the low areas connected by channels. In either case the channels are shallow with flat sides and may be farmed like the rest of the field. Crops are usually planted perpendicular to the channels so that the water flows between the rows to the channels.

Some land grading of the fields where surface drains are installed is usually essential for satisfactory functioning. Land grading is the shaping of the field so that the land slopes toward the drainage channels. The slope may be uniform over the entire field, or it may vary from part to part. Historically, the calculations necessary for planning land grading were time-consuming, a factor that restricted the alternatives available for final design. Today, computer models rapidly explore many possibilities before a final land grading design is selected.

In a subsurface drainage system, often called a tile system, all parts except the outlet are located below the surface of the ground. It provides better drainage than a surface system because it removes water from the soil to the depth of the drain, providing plants a greater mass of soil for root development, permitting the soil to warm up faster in the spring, and maintaining a better balance of bacterial action, the air in the soil, and other factors needed for maximum crop growth.

The smallest component of the subsurface system, the lateral, primarily removes water from the soil. The laterals may be arranged in either a uniform or random pattern. The choice is governed by the crop grown and its value, the characteristics of the soil, and the precipitation pattern.

The primary decision required for a system with uniform laterals is their depth and spacing. In general, the deeper the laterals can be emplaced, the farther apart they can be spaced for an equivalent degree of drainage. Laterals usually are spaced 24 to 91 metres (80 to 300 feet) apart and 0.9 to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet) deep.

Subsurface drainage systems are as important in many irrigated areas as they are in humid areas. A drainage system is needed on irrigated lands to control the water table and ensure that water will be able to move through a soil, thus keeping salts from accumulating in the root zone and making the soil unproductive.

Most subsurface drains are constructed by excavating a trench, installing a tile, and backfilling the trench. Control of the machines to assure proper slope of the drain had been a major problem, but developments in excavation technology, including the use of laser beams for grade control, have helped to solve it. Traditionally, clay or concrete tile has been the principal material used, but many types of perforated plastic tubes are now employed. An advantage is the reduction in weight of the material handled.

With proper maintenance, drainage systems have a relatively long life. Selected herbicides are often applied to keep woody growth and water weeds out of the channels. Grates are usually installed over outlets to prevent rodents and burrowing animals from building nests.

Surface drainage systems need almost yearly maintenance to assure the slope and cross section of the channels and the slope of the graded areas, because the slopes are so flat that small changes in the ground surface can make marked changes in the ability of a system to function.

Subsurface systems need periodic inspection but usually require little servicing. The outlet of the system and infrequent structural failure of the material are the usual points for service.

The continual need for increased food and fibre production requires the continued development of new agricultural lands and increased efficiency of existing agricultural areas. Development of new agricultural areas is rarely possible without irrigation or drainage systems or both. Easily recognized improvements are the large-scale river basin projects designed for flood control, irrigation, and power generation. Such projects are in various stages of design or construction in many countries of the world—for example, China, India, Egypt, Iran, Australia, and the United States. In almost all cases, drainage of the irrigated lands is considered a companion requirement. If possible, the drainage improvements are subsurface.

A combination of drainage and irrigation is used to reclaim large areas of land that have been abandoned because of salt accumulation. In this case, subsurface drainage systems must be installed so that high water tables are lowered and pure water flushed through the soil, dissolving the salts and carrying them away in the drainage water. Large areas in the United States, India, and the Middle East are potentially available for reclamation by this technique.

The people of the Netherlands have reclaimed land from the sea by the use of drainage. Since the IJsselmeer (formerly Zuiderzee) barrier dam was closed in 1932, converting this large body of water into a freshwater lake, the Dutch have been continually enclosing and reclaiming smaller bodies (polders). After dikes are built around a polder, the area is drained by pumping out the water. Drainage channels and, in many places, subsurface drains are installed so that the root zone of crops can be drained. After this, cropping is started as the last step in the reclamation process.

The development of land-clearing machinery and surface drainage techniques has made it possible to clear and drain tropical lands for agricultural production. The first step is the removal of trees, brush, and other tropical growth. Outlet ditches are constructed, followed by drains. In some cases, subsurface drains are possible, but more often the soils and rainfall conditions combine to make this improvement impractical. Surface drains are installed on a uniform pattern and the land is smoothed or graded. Drainage systems on newly reclaimed tropical land require special attention while the soils are stabilizing, and some reconstruction is often needed after the soil stabilization is complete."

draft animal,  any domesticated animal used in drawing heavy loads. Draft animals were in common use in Mesopotamia before 3000 bc for farm work and for pulling wheeled vehicles. Their use spread to the rest of the world over the following 2,500 years. While cattle, usually in teams, have been used most often as draft animals, horses and donkeys have supplanted them in many areas. Some horses—such as the Belgian horse, the Clydesdale, the Suffolk, the Shire, and the Percheron—have been bred to serve as draft animals; they weigh more than 725 kg (1,600 pounds) and stand at least 16 hands high. The Asian water buffalo, however, is probably the most important draft animal in the world today. Many of the some 165 million domesticated water buffalo worldwide are used as draft animals, particularly in tropical Asia, where they assist in the production of rice. The role of draft animals in agriculture in less-developed regions of the world continues because of the advantages they offer: their feed is easily grown and commonly available; little maintenance of the animals is required; their manure is a valuable resource for the farmer; and the animal itself may become a source of food or other products at the end of its useful life.

A harness is necessary in using a draft animal efficiently. Such harnesses must allow the transfer of the animal’s muscle power to the task at hand. With oxen and similar animals a yoke that rests on the back of the animal is used to attach the harness, while with horses and other equines a rigid, padded collar is used. The harness itself may be a simple arrangement of ropes connecting the yoke or collar to a plow, or it may be a complex arrangement of strapping to support the shafts of a cart, wagon, carriage, or sled and to allow the animal to pull the vehicle in comfort, either singly or in concert with others. Long teams of draft animals, used in pairs and numbering as many as 24 animals, were common in the 19th century for pulling especially heavy loads, such as large machine parts or bulk commodities.

In many places the use of mixed teams, as with one horse and one mule or one ox and one cow hitched in tandem, has been common among small farmers. Draft animal power has also been used to pump water, thresh grain, draw barges, and haul logs out of forests in lumbering operations. In addition to bovine and equine species, reindeer, elephants, camels, llamas, sheep, goats, and dogs have been used as draft animals."

domestication,  the process of hereditary reorganization of wild animals and plants into domestic and cultivated forms according to the interests of people. In its strictest sense, it refers to the initial stage of human mastery of wild animals and plants. The fundamental distinction of domesticated animals and plants from their wild ancestors is that they are created by human labour to meet specific requirements or whims and are adapted to the conditions of continuous care and solicitude people maintain for them. See also plant breeding and animal breeding.

Domestication has played an enormous part in the development of humankind and material culture. It has resulted in the appearance of agriculture as a special form of animal and plant production. It is precisely those animals and plants that became objects of agricultural activity that have undergone the greatest changes when compared with their wild ancestors.

The first attempts at domestication of animals and plants apparently were made in the Old World during the Mesolithic Period. Dogs were first domesticated in Central Asia by at least 15,000 years ago by people who engaged in hunting and gathering wild edible plants. The first successful domestication of plants, as well as goats, cattle, and other animals—which heralded the onset of the Neolithic Period—occurred sometime before 9500 bce. It was not until the Neolithic Period, however, that primitive agriculture appeared as a form of social activity, and domestication was well under way. (The Neolithic Period occurred at different times around the world but is generally thought to have begun sometime between 10,000 and 8,000 bce.) Although the great majority of domesticated animals and plants that still serve humans were selected and developed during the Neolithic Period, a few notable examples appeared later. The rabbit, for example, was not domesticated until the Middle Ages; the sugar beet came under cultivation as a sugar-yielding agricultural plant only in the 19th century; and mint became an object of agricultural production as recently as the 20th century. Also in the 20th century, a new branch of animal breeding was developed to obtain high-quality fur.

Domestication of vegetatively reproducing plants, such as those with tubers, probably preceded domestication of the seed plants—cereals, legumes, and other vegetables. Some plants were domesticated for the strong fibres in their stalks, which were used for such purposes as making fishing nets. Hemp, one of the most ancient plants domesticated in India, is an example of a multipurpose plant: oil is obtained from its seeds, fibres from its stalk, and the narcotic hashish from its flowers and leaves.

Some plants were domesticated especially for the production of narcotics; such a plant is tobacco, which was probably first used by American Indian tribes for the preparation of a narcotic drink and only later for smoking. The opium poppy is another example of a plant domesticated solely for a narcotic. Beverage plants of many kinds were discovered and cultivated, including tea, coffee, and cola. Only when humans reached a sufficiently high level of culture did they begin to domesticate to fulfill aesthetic requirements for the beautiful and the bizarre in both plants and animals.

The specific economic application of domesticated animals did not appear at once. Dogs probably accompanied hunters and helped them hunt wild animals; they probably also guarded human settlements and warned the inhabitants of possible danger. At the same time, they were eaten by humans, which was probably their main importance during the first stages of domestication. Sheep and goats were also eaten in the initial stages of domestication but later became valuable for producing the commodities of milk and wool.

The principal aim of cattle breeding in ancient times was to obtain meat and skin and to produce work animals, which greatly contributed to the development of agriculture. Cattle, at the initial stages of domestication, produced a small amount of milk, sufficient only to rear their calves. The development of high milk yield in cows with their breeding especially for milk production is a later event in the history of domestication.

The first domesticated horses were also used for meat and skin. Later the horse played an enormous role in the waging of war. Peoples inhabiting the Middle East in the 2nd millennium bce used horses in chariot battles. With time the horse began to be used as transportation. In the 1st millennium bce carts appeared, and the horses were harnessed to them; other riding equipment, including the saddle and the bit, seems to have appeared in later centuries.

The donkey and the camel were used only for load transport and as means of conveyance; their unpalatability ruled out their use as a preferred food.

The first domesticated hens perhaps were used for sport. Cockfighting was instrumental in bringing about the selection of these birds for larger size. Cocks later acquired religious significance. In Zoroastrianism the cock was associated with protection of good against evil and was a symbol of light. In ancient Greece it was also an object of sacrifice to gods. It is probable that egg production of the first domesticated hens was no more than five to ten eggs a year; high egg yield and improved meat qualities of hens developed at later stages of domestication.

Early domestication of the cat was probably the result of the pleasure experienced from keeping this animal. The cat’s ability to catch mice and rats was surely another reason that impelled people to keep cats at home. In ancient Egypt the cat was considered a sacred animal.

Some animals were domesticated for utilitarian purposes from the very beginning. Here belongs, first of all, the rabbit, whose real domestication was carried out from the 6th to the 10th century ce by French monks. The monks considered newborn rabbits “fish” and ate them during Lent when the church calendar indicated abstinence from meat.

For the sake of honey, the bee was domesticated at the end of the Neolithic Period. Honey has played an enormous role in human nutrition since ancient times; it ceased being the sole sweetening agent only about 200 years ago. Bees also provided wax and bee venom, which was used as medicine. Bees were used also, to a limited extent, in warfare, hives being thrown among enemy troops to rout them.

To obtain silk, the silkworm was domesticated in China no later than 3000 bce, and by 1000 bce the technology of silkworm breeding and raising had been thoroughly documented.

Shepherdy and nomadic animal breeding, which determined the social and economic organization and the way of life of some peoples to a great extent, appeared at later stages of human development, after the accumulation of a large number of domestic animals. Rudiments of nomadic animal breeding in Eurasia appeared no earlier than 1000 bce, considerably after the domestication of animals took place.

The process of domestication in the New World took place somewhat later than in the Old World and independently of the latter, since humans first appeared in the New World only during the end of the Pleistocene Epoch (which lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago), long after settlement of the Old World."

dehydration,  in food processing, means by which many types of food can be preserved for indefinite periods by extracting the moisture, thereby inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. Dehydration is one of the oldest methods of food preservation and was used by prehistoric peoples in sun-drying seeds. The North American Indians preserved meat by sun-drying slices, the Chinese dried eggs, and the Japanese dried fish and rice.

Hot-air dehydration was developed in France in 1795, enabling the commercial production of dehydrated food products, particularly spaghetti and other starch products. Modern dehydration techniques have been largely stimulated by the advantages dehydration gives in compactness; on the average, dehydrated food has about 1/15 the bulk of the original or reconstituted product. The need to transport large shipments of food over great distances during World War II provided much of the stimulus to perfect dehydration processes. The advantages of reduced bulk later came to be appreciated by campers and backpackers and also by relief agencies that provide food in times of emergency and disaster.

Dehydration equipment varies in form with different food products and includes tunnel driers, kiln driers, cabinet driers, vacuum driers, and other forms. Compact equipment suitable for home use is also available. A basic aim of design is to shorten the drying time, which helps retain the basic character of the food product. Drying under vacuum is especially beneficial to fruits and vegetables. Freeze-drying benefits heat-sensitive products by dehydrating in the frozen state without intermediate thaw. Freeze-drying of meat yields a product of excellent stability, which on rehydration closely resembles fresh meat.

The dairy industry is one of the largest processors of dehydrated food, producing quantities of whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and eggs. Many dairy products are spray dried—that is, atomized into a fine mist that is brought into contact with hot air, causing an almost instant removal of moisture content. See also food preservation."

defoliant,   a chemical dust or spray applied to plants to cause their leaves to drop off prematurely. Defoliants sometimes are applied to crop plants such as cotton in order to facilitate harvesting. They are also used in warfare to eliminate enemy food crops and potential areas of concealment by enemy forces. Defoliants were employed for these purposes by South Vietnamese and U.S. forces in the Vietnam War; among the more controversial of these substances was the chemical compound known as Agent Orange (q.v.)."

Rabbit farming is a growing business venture that is becoming popular due to increased demands of rabbit meat.  The business is even more affordable to start as you will require very little investment. The rabbits and pigs give higher returns. 





Rabbits are mainly kept due to their tasty and nutritious meat they produce, their maturity is quite fast and they are ready for slaughter within four months underpinning their role as a great source of income for farmers.

Here are some key factors you need to consider for a successful rabbit farming business.
Breeding
According to roysfarm.com choosing a suitable breed is very important. The site recommends that the best breeds for commercial rabbit farming are California White, Flemish Giant and New Zealand White. You need to choose your breed according to the desired production. You should note that they can give birth to about two to ten young ones depending on different breeds. A farmer should be keen during this process.
They mature very fast. A rabbit is suitable for breeding at the age of six months. This can lead to inbreeding hence the male and females should be separated. 




Housing 
Ensure that the house is neat and clean with good ventilation. While constructing a house for the rabbits ensure there are several cages as the female and males need to be separated. 
This is because rabbits reproduce at a fast rate and this will help you control their reproduction rate.
The rabbit house should be a place where the rabbits can eat, sleep, hide, hop, run, play, jump and dig. To ensure you provide them with adequate space, make sure the cage is 12 square feet with an additional larger area 32 square feet for exercise. 
For proper ventilation, cover the walls, doors, roofs with chicken wire nets or bamboo wood places 20mm apart.
Feeding 
Nutritious and balanced diet food is needed to boost their health and productivity rate. Feeding cost for commercial rabbit farming is low as you can feed them supplementary feeds together with kitchen waste materials, grasses and plant leaves. They should be provided with a sufficient amount of clean and fresh water with proper nutritious rabbit feed.
Management 
Vaccinate them timely to keep them free from diseases that can cause death. Avoid feeding them polluted and expired foods. Monitoring their activities can help you identify the signs and symptoms of diseases. This will help you escape losses that can be incurred after.
Rabbit meat is highly consumed in China and farmers should find a way to export their produce to foreign countries.

A murram road leads to a massive steel gate in Kathienge village in Giaki sub-location, Meru County.

Fridah Meme, clad in black jeans and a marching T-shirt, opens the gate to usher the Seeds of Gold team into her eight-acre farm, on which farms indigenous chickens as well as groundnuts and maize.

“Groundnuts are my main crop because of their higher returns,” says the MSc in Crop Protection student at the University of Nairobi.

""I intercrop the groundnuts with maize. This has enabled me to earn more and through this project I have been able to pay for education comfortably,” adds the 40-year-old.

With groundnuts, she says, one does not need a big farm to earn big from the soil. A 2kg tin of groundnuts is currently going for Sh250 and a 90kg at an average of Sh10,000.

When it comes to planting groundnuts, she says, timing is key for maximum returns.

""Just like maize, groundnut is an early-season crop thus must be grown at the onset of rains. A space of 30-45cm is needed between rows and 15-20cm between plants.”

""This means an acre accommodates about 30,000 plants, which is equivalent to at least 16-20kg of seeds that are sowed to a depth of 5-6cm,"" explains Fridah.

Weeding commences two to three weeks after germination and mounding should be done while weeding to encourage growing of bigger nuts.

Fridah Meme inspects her farm in  Kathienge village in Meru County. 

""I normally do hand-weeding after the start of the penetration of young nuts in the soil to avoid disturbing them or damaging the flowers. Weeding using hoes should take place for six weeks after which only hand weeding should be done.""

To ensure maximum yields, she applies fertiliser with calcium to the crop when pods are forming.

""I also use about 20kg of phosphate fertiliser to boost the firmness of the crop,"" says Fridah, who notes she buys groundnut seeds worth Sh7,000.

To manage diseases like leaf spot, crown rot and pests like termites, aphids, and millipedes which attack roots, stem base, leaves and pods, she plants at the onset of rains.

""I also practice crop rotation and observe farm hygiene by planting certified seeds.” She harvests 1,000kg of nuts from her farm and sells a kilo at between Sh100 and Sh150.

Good harvesting of groundnuts is critical to avoid breaking of pods and seeds, which should be well-dried after shelling to avoid aflatoxin contamination.

Harun Mbogo, an agronomist, says that many farmers end up with aflatoxin-contaminated nuts because of failing to adhere to best practices from planting to harvesting and after harvesting.

""Farmers should do proper mounding of soil during first and second weeding.""

They should also harvest the crop when mature, remove pods and dry them on a canvas for five days followed by winnowing to remove dirt.

Prof Paul Kimurto, a crop scientist at Egerton University, notes that intercropping groundnuts with maize is highly recommended for farmers to break even.

""Intercropping leads to higher returns as total production per hectare increases and ensures more efficiency in land use. It also reduces usage of inputs like nitrogen fertiliser, builds soil organic matter, helps in the suppression of insect pests, weeds and diseases. The need for chemical inputs also goes down.”

Besides groundnuts, Fridah also farms tangerines that she sells at Sh1,500 per crate, keeps 50 chickens selling a tray of eggs at Sh450 and a dairy cow that produces 20 litres a day.

She has also planted green grams, cowpeas and beans on half-acre each.

""I sell green grams and cowpeas at Sh70 per kilo. I sold five 90bags of beans at Sh6,000 and groundnuts earn me at least Sh60,000 a season.""

Food, agriculture, and fisheries depend on the world’s natural resources, so future food production will depend on how well these resources are conserved and used. Agriculture is impacted by urban land expansion and by higher water demand from other sectors. Development in coastal zones complicates fisheries governance in traditional fishing areas. The ocean ecosystem is affected by oil and gas exploration, marine shipping, and land-based industries, whose pollution can lead to habitat loss and declining biodiversity. Agricultural risk “hotspots” occur where these resource pressures are most concentrated. These places are expected to have the most difficulty maintaining food production.



The demand for resources is complicated by climate change. By 2050, climate change could cause global average yields of rice, wheat and maize to be between 6-10% less than they otherwise would be, while water stresses in key regions in Northwest India, Northeast China and Southwestern United States could by themselves cause an increase in the international price of the same crops by 5 to 7% by 2050.

The food, agriculture and fisheries system is not only impacted by the environment, but also by production techniques that can affect impact land, water, biodiversity, and greenhouse gasses.

The agriculture sector is directly responsible for 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, mostly due to methane emissions from livestock and rice, and from nitrous oxide emissions from fertilisers. It is the largest water consuming sector, and can harm biodiversity and reduce water quality from runoff of fertiliser, manure, and pesticides. The excessive use of nutrients in agriculture has been a major source of water pollution, and is estimated to have reduced biodiversity in rivers, lakes and wetlands by about one-third globally.

OECD analysis shows that while progress has been made in improving the impact of agriculture on the environmental and natural resources, there are still significant challenges in the use of resources and pollution in many countries.

Overfishing, including illegal fishing, has led to depleted fish stocks, with about one-third of global marine stocks biologically overfished, up from about 10% in the mid-1970s. This threatens the functioning of marine ecosystems and results in fewer opportunities for fishers. Better fisheries management systems could generate an additional USD 80 billion in value each year.

As global demand for food and non-food products continues to increase, driven largely by population and income growth, the challenge of addressing resource depletion and climate change can also be expected to increase. The world’s population is projected to reach 9.5 billion by 2050, with much of the increase taking place in Sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Middle East and North Africa. Income growth in developing and emerging countries is also stimulating demand for more, and a greater diversity of, food and non-food products.



Digitalisation holds considerable potential to transform the food, agriculture and fisheries system in coming years. Mobile devices, data analytics, high quality satellite imagery, precision equipment, and artificial intelligence – amongst others – could contribute greatly to increase productivity, sustainability and resilience across the sector. In principle, new technological developments could make it possible for farmers to monitor their crops and livestock with greater precision, to fine-tune applications of inputs (such as fertilizers and feed supplements), and to use large amounts of data to determine optimal agriculture and aquaculture production choices. Farmers and fishers could more easily connect to markets and to essential up-to-date market information, while traceability systems can follow products along the value chain, providing consumers with information on the orgin of food they buy.

Digital technologies could also enable more comprehensive monitoring of illegal fisheries, helping to manage stocks more sustainably. They can also help target and improve agriculture and environmental policies by linking support to verifiable outcomes, and to facilitate cross-border trade, for example by automating administrative and customs procedures.

Some of these technologies exist today, while others are still in early stages of development. In either case, digital applications in agriculture will not automatically be available to all. Special attention will be required to ensure that farmers and fishers in less developed economies, and those in more remote areas, can benefit. In many cases this will mean significantly increased (public and private) investment in digital infrastructure and in education and training; failure to make these investments risks to create a ‘digital divide’ that would leave too many behind.

There is a growing urgency for governments to realign policies in light of the emerging challenges and opportunities. Governments could begin immediately to roll back policy measures that can potentially harm the environment, including by encouraging unsustainable production. Doing so would also release scarce financial resources that could be devoted to high-return investments in innovation systems, in physical and digital infrastructure, in targeted climate and environmental measures, and in risk management systems. Such targeted and tailored policy efforts would pave the way for progress to be made opening markets for freer and fairer trade in food, agriculture and fisheries products.

Better policies can be underpinned by strengthened international cooperation, both to create better information on shared risks (climate and other environmental changes and on research and development gaps, for example) and to identify potential solutions of widespread interest (climate-resilient infrastructure, land and water management, weather related risk mitigation, and new digital applications, for example).

Changing policies for food, agriculture and fisheries is seldom easy, as potential impacts on rural livelihoods, income distribution, and competitiveness create significant uncertainties. Policy reform processes must be well designed to enable those affected to have a voice, to anticipate negative impacts, and to have in place transitionary support to facilitate desired structural adjustments. National governments can work with sub-national public bodies, businesses, and civil society groups to strengthen domestic cooperation, both to facilitate policy reform and to address local problems, including in particular as regards the environment.

Governments have traditionally intervened heavily in the agricultural sector, probably more so than in any other productive sector of the economy. Historically, governments have done so because they were concerned about ensuring an adequate level of farmer income and sufficient and affordable food supplies for their populations. While these objectives are still important today, many governments have broadened the scope of their policies to achieve other goals, including contributing to more competitive and innovative industries and environmentally sustainable production systems that are more resilient to climate change and other risks.

Countries broadly share these goals, but their importance varies depending on countries’ individual circumstances. Many developed countries have long provided support to farm incomes, but as their economies grow and transform, other objectives often become important, such as sustaining the environment. In many developing countries, agriculture and fisheries make a much more significant contribution to overall economic growth and employment. Governments often try to stimulate production and raise incomes by lowering the costs of key inputs, or raising the prices of outputs; at the same time, these same governments often strive to keep domestic food prices low, in particular for the poorest.

The OECD monitors and evaluates agricultural policies in 53 countries that, together, provide more than half a trillion dollars a year in support to agriculture. More than three-quarters of this support goes directly to farmers, while the remainder is public investment in agricultural innovation systems (i.e. research and development, agricultural extension and training, and education), in food safety and quality inspection systems, and in physical infrastructure. Of course, there are vast differences between countries.



 

Over the last 20 years, the level of support provided to farmers in many countries has fallen. Support provided to farmers has also started to be more disconnected (“decoupled”) from production – meaning that many farmers no longer receive payments or higher prices for producing a specific commodity – and has instead begun to target environmental outcomes and better access to risk management tools. But some developed countries continue to provide high levels of support, while some emerging economies have increased their level of support, albeit from low or even negative levels.

Government support to fisheries is substantial, but much less in total than support provided to agriculture. Fisheries support includes payments to individual fishers, such as for modernisation of vessels, as well as investments in port infrastructure and fisheries monitoring, surveillance and control. Excise tax exemptions and subsidies for fuel use are also common, sometimes directed specifically at the fisheries sector and sometimes as part of wider support prgrammes. In 2016, support directly targeted to fisheries totalled almost USD 3 billion for all OECD countreis included in the Fisheries Support Estimate database.



Some measures are more effective in achieving specific policy objectives than others. Public spending on agricultural innovation and inspection services, for example, are particularly effective at raising sustainable agricultural productivity growth. Payments to farmers can be tailored to specific policy objectives – like improved environmental performance on farms – by targeting specific locations, groups of farms, or by attaching conditions to their receipt. Keeping domestic prices artificially high (above international levels, for example, through imposing import restrictions) allows governments to support farmers without directly burdening the public budget, but the cost is borne by consumers, and the burden falls disproportionately heavy on the least well off.

Domestic price support, output payments, and input subsidies not only distort production decisions and trade flows, they can potentially have negative impacts on the environment. Because these measures are contingent on production, they can lead farmers to overuse inputs and increase pressure on the environment. And because these types of support measures often target specific commodities, they can reduce resilience and adaptation to climate change by encouraging farmers to plant specific crops, even if they are not well-suited to local climate conditions.

These measures can also have significant and negative effects on the welfare, resilience and food security of consumers and producers. In some countries, the use of market access barriers and distorting forms of domestic support is motivated by food security concerns, as countries aim to achieve higher rates of food self-sufficiency. But higher market prices disproportionally hurt poorer vulnerable households by raising the price of staple foods. This includes small farmers, who may be net buyers of agricultural products. Some governments maintain public stocks to shield consumers from food price spikes, particularly in developing countries. However, large public stockholding programmes can have unintentional impacts on domestic and international markets, and can increase price volatility.

There are both opportunities and challenges to meeting future demands for food, agriculture and fisheries products in a sustainable manner, and in the context of a changing climate.

Policies continue to evolve as countries develop more targeted, and less market-distorting ways to address income goals, risks, and the challenge of improving productivity in environmentally sustainable ways. Still, agro-food products in general face higher tariffs than industrial goods, and are more likely to face non-tariff measures arising from domestic regulations. External pressure arising from international agreements play an important role, starting with the adoption of the 1994 Agreement on Agriculture (part of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations that led to the creation of the World Trade Organization). While progress in both agriculture and fisheries trade negotiations at the multilateral level remains slow, efforts have been intensifying, including at the WTO.

Going forward, aligning food, agriculture and fisheries policies with the emerging needs of the sector will require governments to distinguish between measures that provide income support to households in need from those that aim to increase productivity, sustainability, and resilience to climate change and other risks. It will also require a more integrated policy approach, ensuring that policy packages are coherent with economy-wide measures and responsive to the needs of the entire food system, from ‘stable to table’. Work at the OECD creates new data, information, analysis, and advice to support government decision-making on practical ways to improve their policy performance.

How will the global food, agriculture and fisheries system evolve in coming decades? A lot will depend on government policies.

The OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook projects that demand for food, agriculture and fisheries products will continue to grow over the next decade. However, growth will be at a slower pace than in the recent past, when exceptionally strong growth in China and the largely policy-induced expansion of biofuels spurred demand. The main exception to this slowdown in demand growth is fresh dairy, as income and population growth in India are expected to lead to a strong increase in consumption. Despite slower growth, the additional demand for most commodities will still be considerable, with most of the extra demand coming from China, India, and Sub-Saharan Africa.



Because of differences in geography, climate and population density, some parts of the world are better suited to produce food, agriculture, and fisheries products than others. Over the past few decades, international trade between these regions has intensified. Countries in North and South America in particular have emerged as major agricultural exporters. At the same time, agricultural imports have increased in Sub-Saharan Africa, in the Middle East and North Africa, and in South and East Asia (most notably in China). These trends are expected to continue over the coming years, underscoring the growing importance of international trade for global food security.

Across the globe, countries are in various stages of evolution from (primarily) physical economies, to service economies, to digital economies – and potentially to the “single economy”, where data are pervasive across all economic activities and society. Much international attention today is focused on how best to harness the enormous opportunities associated with digitilisation, while avoiding potential threats to specific jobs and to countries, regions, sectors, and individuals who may be unable to invest in, and benefit from, digitilisation.



The food, agriculture and fisheries sector will need to situate itself within this wider framework, to ensure coherence across policy fields domestically and to avoid policy fragmentation internationally. This will require a greater level of international co-operation than is evident today. In many countries, it will also require much greater investments, and public-private collaboration, in digital infrastructure and related education and training than is available today.

Of course, traditional research and development remains a priority and more could usefully be done by both the private and public sectors. Plant and animal breeding to enhance productivity and resilience to climatic events, development of less environmentally harmful plant protection chemicals, and improved fertilizers are amongst the priority areas for a more sustainable agriculture.

Global production of food, agriculture and fisheries is on track to meet rising global demand. The capacity of the sector to respond to even unexpected increases in demand remains strong, in both developed and developing regions of the world. The most recent spike in many commodity prices, in 2007-08, for example, sparked an immediate supply response that satisfied markets and replenished stocks quickly.

Countries can do more to shift some of the resources they dedicate to the sector to support research and development (to advance new technologies) and technology transfer and extension services (to increase adoption and appropriate of available technologies and best practises). The economic case for doing is clear, as the well documented returns to R&D are huge.

Countries can also do much more to open markets, allowing goods to flow more easily and predictably from where they are best produced on a sustainable basis to where they are consumed. While border restrictions matter, behind-the-border non-tariff measures (NTMs) are particularly important in the food, agriculture and fisheries sector. While NTMs often facilitate trade, poorly designed measures can sometimes impose unnecessary costs on traders, disadvantaging smaller producers in particular.

A key challenge is whether continued growth in production can be achieved sustainably. Agriculture has a considerable environmental footprint, as the largest user of the world’s land and water resources and an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. Fish stocks are under increasing pressure from overfishing, while aquaculture raises concerns about the degradation of ecosystems. Under current policy settings, the food, agriculture and fisheries sector can be expected to continue to under-perform with respect to sustainability, climate, and resilience goals expressed by governments.

Governments have an opportunity to begin to roll back ineffective policies that are, in many cases, simply legacies of the past. In this way, scarce financial resources will be released that can be devoted to coherent policy packages that can contribute to a productive, sustainable, and resilient sector. The recipe will differ across countries, but the basic ingredients are largely the same.

The implications of such a policy shift are significant. While consumers and society overall can be expected to benefit substantially, the burden of adjustment will fall more narrowly on relatively resource-poor farm households unable to adjust on their own. In some cases adjustment within in the sector will be possible, with time and transitionary support from governments; in other cases adjustment will require moving out of the sector to more remunerative employment opportunities. Well targeted temporary income support and active labor market measures will be required to support the needed adjustment, ensuring that no one is left behind.

From hunting and gathering to modern day food, agriculture and fisheries value chains, fears that food production could not keep up with population growth have pre-occupied mankind. Thomas Malthus, in his famous Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), predicted mass starvation that would only be corrected by war and pestilence, thus reducing the population to a more manageable size.



In reality, farmers and fishers have continuously increased production, more than keeping pace with population and income growth. At first, farming (and fishing) activities were expanded onto more and more land (and water). Around the middle of the twentieth century, food production and agricultural land use became increasingly independent: between 1960 and today, world population more than doubled, global food production more than tripled, and agricultural land use increased by less than 15%.

Farmers intensified production by using better inputs, such as synthetic fertilisers, improved varieties, and crop protection chemicals and by adopting better management practises, such as crop rotation to sustain soils and irrigation to improve water use. Fisheries exploited new technologies, and increasingly aquaculture, to increase global fish production. These innovations allowed more to be produced using the same amount of land and water, though too often contributing to pressures on sustainable use of the natural resource base.

The world population doubled over the last 50 years to 7.5 billion people, while the share of the population suffering from food and nutrition insecurity fell from 15% in 2000 to around 11% today. While an unacceptably high 820 million people are still food insecure, it is not because food is not available. The root cause of hunger and malnutrition today is poverty – often exacerbated by conflict – that inhibits access to food.

The conditions in which food are produced vary tremendously across the world. In advanced countries, technological innovations are bringing high-tech solutions to many farms. At the same time, small farms with less than two hectares of land represent 84% of farms globally, but produce only one-third of global crop production. Farmers and fishers operating on a small scale seldom have either the resources or the education to access the latest technologies, and often hesitate to try new approaches they perceive as too risky to their own food security and livelihoods.

Following the widespread uptake of aquaculture production, particularly in Asia, almost 60 million people work in the fisheries and aquaculture sector today, almost twice as many as in the early 1990s. At the same time, global seafood consumption has grown more rapidly than all other meats combined. Food production per farmer has also increased strongly, while the share of the global population working in agriculture has fallen. Today, agriculture accounts for only 3% of total employment in high-income countries, but over 40% in some major emerging economies such as India, and an even higher total in some less developed economies, including many in Africa.



Producing food has always been a risky business. Crop production depends on good quality soil and water, along with predictable weather and a sufficient growing season, while livestock disease can cause major harm to human and animal health. Drought can lead to supply shortages, and fluctuations in exchange rates or new trade restrictions can contribute to price volatility. These risks directly affect the economic returns from agriculture, impacting the livelihood of farmers.

The challenges facing the food, agriculture and fishery sectors will increase with climate change. Global average temperatures have been setting new records almost every year, while rain has become less reliable. Extreme weather events that destroy crops – like floods, droughts and large storms – have become more common. Pests, weeds, viruses and disease move to new areas and affect crops, livestock and aquaculture production. Climate change is also altering the productivity of capture fisheries and the distribution of fish stocks, making future harvests less certain.

Despite all of these uncertainties, food prices have significantly decreased over the long run as growth in production exceeded growth in demand. But in 2007-2008 spikes in food prices, due to a virtual ‘perfect storm’ of factors (poor harvests, low stocks, export restrictions, etc.), were followed by a period of relatively high price volatility. A decade later, conditions on world agricultural markets are very different, and real prices for almost all commodities are expected to resume their long term trend downwards over the coming decade.

Global food, agriculture and fishery systems are incredibly diverse. While regions like North and South America have a lot of agricultural land, and have emerged as major agricultural exporters, other regions such as the Middle East and North Africa have relatively little agricultural land and water. In addition, many agricultural products only grow in specific climates or soils. Developing countries, like China and Viet Nam, have displaced advanced economies as the major source of fish products globally.

As a result, trade in food, agriculture and fisheries products has never been as important as it is today. Much of the food we eat each and every day arrives to our grocery stores, restaurants, refrigerators and plates thanks to trade. Consumers enjoy fresh fruit and vegetables out of season, and have access to meat and fish from foreign fields and oceans.



Today, a small number of countries account for a large share of exports of some agricultural commodities, reflecting strong comparative advantage in production. For example, five countries account for more than two-thirds of the global wheat and beef exports. For soybeans the share exceeds 90%. Even for commodities where the share of the five main exporters is more modest, a single country often dominates, as in the case of sugar (Brazil accounts for 45% of global exports), oilseeds (Canada accounts for 54% of global exports), roots and tubers (Thailand accounts for 56% of global exports), and several dairy products.

Compared with exports, agricultural imports are typically less concentrated, with trade flowing from a small number of exporters to a larger number of importers. Notable exceptions are soybeans and other oilseeds, roots and tubers, and other coarse grains, where demand from China dominates.

At the same time, the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) has increased the interconnectedness of our economies, as various stages of production of the food we eat and the clothing we wear take place in different countries around the world. This creates potential new opportunities, but also challenges, for farmers and fishers to benefit from indirect access to global markets, by participating directly in domestic value chains. The nature of consumer demand is also changing, again creating both new opportunities and challenges for primary producers and downstream food processors and distributors.

Since the time of Malthus, the global food system has responded to the needs of a growing and more affluent world population. But farmers and fishers operate in a world of constant change, and the pace of change is increasing. Governments have an important role to play to ensure that its policies, institutions, and infrastructure are fit for purpose, providing the enabling environment for the sector to be increasingly productive, sustainable, resilient and responsive to consumer demand.

Government policies and interventions play a major role in shaping food and agriculture markets, but policies are not always well aligned to evolving objectives.

89,Agriculture,"I tried my hand at watermelon farming after my great uncle nudged me to try. He told me that he had a lot of seed and different watermelon cultivars and I should give a try. I live in a high altitude area and I knew that even if I was to try to grow watermelon, my best bet was to grow them during the hot and dry season. This is because during the rainy season, the dampness and cold would cause the challenge of fungal diseases of which watermelons are prone.

 

I agreed to try my hand at watermelon farming. The seeds I got were about 4 watermelon and 2 cantaloupe cultivars. When the dry season came around I prepared the little plot of land. I decided to divide the trial into open field and greenhouse tunnel.

 

I had researched and found out that watermelon vines can grow quite long and require more space than other plants that I was used to planting, like tomatoes and cabbages. I thus gave a space of about a meter, inter-row, and about half a meter plant to plant. I read that depending on how vigorous the plants were, thinning of plants may also be necessary.

 

From germination, the watermelon plants seemed to be doing well. I closely monitored the progress and from my time planting tomatoes, I had learned that prevention is better than cure. I started a weekly spray programme to control both insect damage as well as fungal diseases. Plants in both open field and greenhouse tunnel were treated the same.

 

The greenhouse plants growth was slightly more vigorous. This I attributed to the more controlled temperature fluctuations in the greenhouse. The challenge I encountered with the greenhouse grown watermelon was that of pollination. This is because as the greenhouse in a closed space, and there will be no insects to pollinate the flowers and the wind is next to non-existent. The few flowers that I was able to pollinate manually did develop into fruit in the greenhouse, otherwise most just fell off.

 

The outside grown watermelons did better in terms of pollination and fruit development. Another practice I carried over to watermelon growing was that of reducing the number of buds. I had read that the more fruit on a vine, the smaller the fruit would be. I thus left only two fruit per vine.

 

Despite the problematic pollination, the watermelon grown In the greenhouse did better in terms of size of fruit and sweetness too.

 

Would I do it again?

 

Considering that I live in the highlands where it tends to get a bit cool, I would only do plant the watermelons in the hot dry season under irrigation.

88,Agriculture,"Water is vital for life and this applies to farming too. Water is needed by both plants and animals.

The water supply on the farm has gone through a few changes. There is a small river that passes through the farm and is the primary source of water. It is pumped to the farm using various means.

My grandfather had installed a diesel powered water pump some years back. This was costly as the price of fuel, including diesel has been rising throughout the years.

 

Water flowing from a hydram

At some point there was a hydram pump(hydraulic ram- a kind of pump that only uses the flow of water to pump water) installed by the settler farmers who once inhabited these here parts. It is a very cheap system to run as it doesn't consume any power or fuel, being powered only by the flowing of water.

 

At some point, the farm had been abandoned and things went into disrepair and some things were vandalized. When we went back to the farm, there was no way to pump water. Water had to be fetched by hand. Needless to say, it wasn't efficient nor Viable to farm in this way.

 

It was decided that the old trusty hydram should be setup. The one thing that one should consider when setting up a hydram is the drop(difference in height/elevation between the inlet to the pump and the actual location of the pump). The greater the drop, the more pressure/ volume of water that can be pumped. The drop that we have is a medium one so the water volume pumped is not that much. That is the only drawback of the hydram system that was installed. It however operates continuously, day and night.






 




 

As the volume of water is not that high, planning to use the water for irrigation farming is not viable, as it can only supply a small area in addition to watering the animals and household use.

This was part of the reason why my coriander farming failed, as the pump couldn't irrigate the whole area under cultivation.

 

The pump as with any other type of machinery, does fail once in a while and needs repairs. These are usually moving parts, pipe fittings or gaskets. During this time, as repairs are done, a gasoline powered water pump is used. It does pump a large volume of water in a shorter time, but it is expensive to run.

 

Thoughts on water pumping

 

one cannot do without water in farming. However it is a key cost to be considered as nothing can grow without water. The best way would be to find the least costly way to irrigate the land. The cheapest is rain fed agriculture. This has constraints as it isn't always raining, and most plants need a fairly consistent water supply.

 

The other way is mechanical irrigation. This involves moving water mechanically from source to the farm. Electricity would be one of the considerations, if it is readily available and cost effective. Unfortunately in our case the farm is a bit far from the power lines and connecting to the grid is going to cost an arm and a leg.

 

Solar power is a consideration as we do live in the tropics and we do receive plenty of sunshine. The problem with this is that most solar powered pumps have a lower throughput than the equivalent electric powered ones. They also do have a higher acquisition cost. Lastly they cannot be used on cloudy days as the throughput will be little if any.

 

Hydram is a good way to pump water. This is because other than the setup and maintenance costs, it is the cheapest to run as it doesn't have direct consumables. The only drawback is that the throughput water volumes aren't high compared to the electric or fuel powered pumps.

 

All matters considered, I would probably rank them in order of cost effectiveness as electric, solar, hydram and fuel powered.

87,Agriculture,"Vermiculture is the keeping of worms for production mainly of vermicompost and their waste liquid called leachate. I came upon this idea after looking for an organic way to add nutrients back into the soil as opposed to using inorganic fertilizer.

 

My research into this made me look for a source of worms to start up my project. My search led me to a local university where a lecturer had a project she was doing on vermiculture. After I had contacted her and gotten an appointment, I went to get my worms. She was interested in how I arrived at my conclusion on vermiculture. She said it was unusual for a man to be interested in that kind of thing as she had mainly dealt with interested women. She went as far as to tell me that women had even formed cooperatives in India to produce vermicompost.

 

Once she had explained how to take care of the worms and how to collect the vermicompost, I bought my container full of worms to go and start my vermiculture venture. As the worms were too little to start right away in a large pit, I had researched and saw that I could begin with a few plastic containers fitted into each other with holes drilled into one for leachate removal, and air for the worms to breathe.

 

I wanted to used all the farmyard waste to create compost using the worms. This was to include cow dung, cow feed waste and weeds. This was to be achieved by digging a shallow pit with a slight incline for the leachate to drain and be collected on one side. Once all the pit has been filled with the material to be composted, it is wade wet with water and covered with some leaves or plastic covering. The worms would then be put in one side of the pit and covered. The worms usually start at the top layer and work their way down in the compost conversion. The pit should be checked about once a week and once the manure has been broken down it will usually look a darkish colour. This top layer can then be removed and used on the plants.

 

The leachate is the liquid that the worms excrete and is also believed to be highly nutritious to the plants and have beneficial microbes to plants. It is however not to be used as is and should be diluted in a ratio of at least 1:10 with water.

 

As my initial production was still small, the little compost and leachate I got was first used on house plants and a few selected plants in the kitchen garden. The results looked promising after my initial trial. I thus decided to try a small plot of land with my first sizable production of compost.

 

In this trial I had planted a few lines of maize as it was maize planting season. As time went by, people would ask me what I had applied to the maize as they looked healthier and growing at a slightly faster rate than the rest of the maize. This indicated that if other people could see the difference, I was onto something.

 

I have since grown lots of crops nourished with this compost and leachate. I found that, in my case, better returns were observed in my green leafy vegetables like kales, broccoli and cabbage.

 

There are some other uses whereby the worms can be used as chicken and pig feed, when you have a good supply.

 

Would I do it again?

 

I believe that vermiculture is something almost anybody can do even in an urban setting. Almost all organic kitchen scraps and waste save for the likes of meat and onion family and citrus family, can be used to create compost. This can then in turn be used to grow things in your kitchen garden. On a larger scale for farmers, it can assist in breaking down farmyard waste like cow, pig, goats and sheep manure into very highly nutritious compost for spreading around the farm.

 

So short answer is yes, I believe it is great for the soil and a good way to get rid of organic waste.

85,Agriculture,"I grew this crop as part of my fodder crop and also for crop rotation. My little research showed that a crop like sunflower was good to add to a crop rotation program as they have deep roots. This would help keep the soil structure and nutrients balanced especially when rotated with a shallow rooted crop like maize.

 

Sunflower in general is not a difficult crop to grow. Its spray program for me was mostly to control insects. I did see much, if any, in form of fungal diseases that affected it.

 

Most people round the farm couldn't understand why I would want to do sunflower farming, especially as a fodder crop. I has however researched and seen that it was a good energy source and required a shorter growing period as compared to maize, which is the most popular crop for fodder.

 

Sunflower has various varieties I tried a non hybrid one with low fat content as well as a hybrid, high fat content. The hybrid, high fat content one seemed to do better. I guess the better genetics through hybrid vigour.

 

I thought heliotropism was a myth(sunflower plants following the course of the sun throughout the day), but once my plants developed flowers I actually witnessed it. It was fascinating to see the flower heads facing the east as the sun came up, and west when it set. Nature is amazing!

 

I didn't let my crop of sunflower get to maturity and dry. As soon as the plants had flowers had filled up their flower heads about half way, I harvested the crop for chopping up and ensiling. I must say it isn't the most appetizing feed to cows, or maybe it was because they weren't used to it. But the cows never really ate the sunflower silage with the zest they do maize or sorghum silage.

 

Another reason I did the sunflower was because I knew it was a good forage crop for the bees. I also wanted to taste what the honey would taste like when the bees foraged on the sunflower. However,by the time the sunflower crop was harvested, the bees had not put enough honey on the combs to cap it. I had to wait another 3-4 months for my taste of sunflower infused honey. I remember it has some nice smell and taste to it. This is especially because most of the honey I consume is harvested in the lowlands which is hotter and drier. Maybe the lack of a lot and diversified forage makes the honey not have much of a bouquet.

 

The one big problem I had with sunflower farming was birds. These little critters are tenacious. I had to employ a number of method from hanging wind blown shiny artifacts in the farm, to actually employing someone to shoo away the birds. If left unchecked, these can cause 100% loss of the crop.

 

Would I grow it again?

Sunflower is a good crop to take care of in the early stages. The headache comes in once they have heads which are filling out with seed. This is the most tiresome stage. Also because I was the only farmer to grow the crop in about a 10km radius, and the acreage was small, was the reason I got so much bird trouble.

For the bird problem alone, which I guess even with larger acreage will still compound, I wouldn't grow sunflower again.

84,Agriculture,"I began thinking of sorghum as a viable fodder crop for my animals when I attended an agricultural show in the area. There was a sorghum variety I saw from one of the seed companies that looked quite impressive. It was as tall , if not taller, than the tallest maize crop at the show. It also had a lot of foliage which I figured was good especially for fodder for the cows.

 

Sorghum growing in the field

I immediately began planning on how to grow the sorghum on the farm. There were many varieties of sorghum, and as I came to find out later, they were not all equal. At the show I actually went to the stand by the company with the impressive variety of sorghum. When I enquired on whether I could purchase some sorghum seed, I was informed that they were all sold out. I couldn't believe it, it was just the second day of the show! I was told that the only way I could try and get seed was to contact the head office. Long story short, it was a long wait before I got the seed.

In the meantime not to be deterred from the dream of sorghum farming as fodder, I decided to try another sorghum variety first. This one was more commonly available and was dual purpose. Could be used as human food and fodder for the cows. I got to planting and the trial begun.

 

The first sorghum variety did not grow as impressive as the variety I had in mind. It was barely 5 feet tall and had way less foliage than what I thought I would get. It also seemed to get affected bu some sort of disease that would turn the leaves with spotty red marks on the leaves the older the plant grew.

 

My second trial was a white sorghum variety of sorghum. Still not having got the good variety I was after, I decided to try this “sweet” variety out. I had however been advised that it was better suited for the lower, warmer climate, but the person I was buying from said that it “can” perform well even in my high altitude zone. This did not go well at all. The plant barely got to 3 feet tall and the foliage was very disappointing. This variety I didn't even wait for the second crop. I cut my losses and ploughed it in. the first variety I tried I did let it grow a second time from the cuttings.

 

There was a sorghum variety I got from a different company that was imported and was sold as a fodder crop. As I was seriously looking into establishing sorghum as the main fodder crop, I tried growing it. It was slightly better than the “sweet” variety but was equally unimpressive as far as height and foliage go. I ploughed this variety after the first harvest.

 

I finally was able to get the sorghum variety I had seen at the agricultural show almost 3 years before. I however had to call in favors and use a few connections I had to get the seed. Needless to say, it was an expensive affair. The seed cost about 1.5 times the cost of the other types I had tried. I had a lot of hope in this variety and it did not disappoint. It grew quite well compared to the other varieties. Where the soil was fertile enough, the sorghum grew to a minimum of 6 feet tall and had a lot of foliage. From one planting from seed, I usually got about 3 good harvests of crop for making silage. However, the consecutive harvests go reducing. So I usually plough after every 3rd harvest.

 

The main reason I was willing to pursue sorghum as a fodder crop was that the variety I was after had a lot of foliage. It also was a plus that sorghum grows again from the cuttings left. The one drawback I had read as regards sorghum as a fodder is the possibility of cyanide poisoning. This is especially true if the area the sorghum is grown is hot, or if there is a drought when it is growing.

There is a way to prevent cyanide poisoning in consumption of sorghum as fodder. Ensiling the sorghum greatly reduces(or even eliminates) the risk of cyanide poisoning.

 In terms of performance, the dairy cows seemed to do slightly less well when fed on sorghum silage , as compared to maize silage.

 

Would I grow it again?

I believe the slightly lower energy value of sorghum as compared to maize is offset by the fact that, it can be harvested more than once. The risk of poisoning being eliminated by ensiling means that it is, in my view, worth planting.

I intend to have some sorghum crop as long as I am doing dairy farming.

The other reason I would prefer growing sorghum is that there is plenty of wildlife around that is quite a nuisance. This is especially so for maize. The porcupines and monkeys always know when the crop is just about ready and cant get enough of it! The same is not true for sorghum, which they don't show interest.

83,Agriculture,"Maize has been grown on our farm since way back. It is not only a staple in our diet but more recently it is fodder for the cows. Maize is the main ingredient that makes our staple food called ugali. It is eaten with just about anything. I have a feeling most people would say you give them ugali or give them death.

 

Harvesting maize for silage production

Maize farming is pretty straightforward. The first step is land preparation. This begins with ploughing, then harrowing to make the soil finer, then lastly planting. In more recent years, I prefer to make furrows so as to have straight evenly placed lines of crop. This is better as opposed to planting purely by hand. 

Once the land preparation is done, usually just before the onset of the rains, the planting is then done. I usually have it done by hand as having it done mechanically is usually a bit more expensive. I also prefer to use farmyard manure as opposed to inorganic fertilizer when planting. The only exception is urea, which I used to top dress the maize crop.

Once planted, but before the maize plant germinates, I have found it useful to use a pre-emergent herbicide. It keeps the maize field clean until the maize crop is able to cover the ground and weeds trying to grow. The competition is thus reduced and the maize can do better.

 

I would ultimately prefer my maize farming to go the conservation agriculture way. This way the soil is disturbed less, weeds are not a problem due to the soil cover and the plants do better as opposed to purely rain-fed agriculture.

 

Once the maize is germinated, a spray program is the followed. This is to control insects and worms. In recent years there has been more infestation of cut worms especially. The other reason is to give the maize crop a boost with some foliar fertilizer. The foliar fertilizer I believe benefits the crop to be healthier.

 

Once the crop is about 2-3 feet tall, I usually top dress with urea. This is to help the crop grow well so that they are able to produce good ears of maize. I have found if the crop grows poorly in the earlier stages, the production is low and cannot be corrected later.

 

With everything managed in terms of growing, the only other aspect to be controlled in my case is crop damage from wild animals. The farm borders a forest. There is wildlife here that is a challenge. The most destructive being the monkeys. The other are porcupine. These two have to be controlled as both can lead to huge losses. I employ some people to guard the maize once the ears have cobs which are filling or filled with seed. Birds are also a problem to to a smaller degree.

 

When the maize crop is for making silage, the duration the maize has to be guarded is shorter. If it is for human consumption, the labor is required until the maize is dry enough to harvest. The wildlife problem is one of the reasons I prefer sorghum for fodder.

 

Once harvested and dried properly, the maize for human consumption is threshed and stored in airtight tanks. This makes sure there is very little post harvest loss. The olden ways of harvesting maize and putting into gunny bags, I have found to be problematic. Losses occur from weevil damage, rodents and rotting when maize comes into contact with moisture. The plastic airtight tanks control all the above problems.

 

The maize for silage is harvested at the dough stage. This is where the maize see has filled out but still has some moisture in the seed that when squeezed with the thumb produces some “milk”. The crop is then cut, chopped up, compressed to drive out all the air, then finally covered with an airtight plastic. It is the usually given about a month or two to ferment. After this period, the silage can then be fed to the cows.

 

Would I grow it again?

 

This is a staple food, I therefore grow it for Own consumption.

It is also a good fodder crop and is one of the highest in energy value to cows. Despite the challenges, I include it in list of crops that I grow.

				© 2022 My farming Journey			"
82,Agriculture," I grew a total of two seasons of sweet lupin. This was a protein source for my cows. I found out about sweet lupin after researching about protein sources for my dairy herd. We were already feeding soya as part of the protein mix for the cows ration. Soya in recent years has been going up in price. As dairy firms operate on very thin margins, I was looking for a way to reduce the cost of feeding the cows while still maintaining production levels.

From my research, I found out that sweet lupin is almost similar in crude protein content to soya. I then went about looking for seed. I found out that it wasn't a very popular crop grown by farmers around and thus was not readily available in the agro-vet shops. My searching for seeds led me to the agricultural research institute where I was lucky enough to get some seed. It was however expensive, in my view, compared to the seeds for other crops I was used to buying like maize and sorghum.

The staff at the agricultural research institute were kind enough to give me a pamphlet with some guiding instructions on sweet lupin farming. I came to find out that the cost of the seed was only the tip of the iceberg as regards cost of growing the crop.

In the instructions for sweet lupin farming, I was advised to do a number of things. The first was that it was recommended to use some rhizobium to inoculate the seed before planting. The rhizobium was not readily available, this was because the plant is not so common and popular among farmers around. I had to contact one of the local fertilizer companies to see if I could get some. I was given a two week waiting period while they were preparing some rhizobium for me.

Once I received the rhizobium, also before planting I was advised to also add some bio-fungicide called trianum to the field where I was to plant the sweet lupin. This was to help the plant to resist fungal diseases among them damping off and rotting. I was starting to see that sweet lupin farming would be an expensive affair. This would only be the beginning of costly affair of growing sweet lupin.

In my first trial, I underestimated how frequently the crop required preventative spraying because of fungal infections. The fungal disease I came to find out, spread pretty fast once the crop s affected. With fungal diseases in plants I came to find out that prevention is better than cure. The affected plants would begin with discolouration from green to yellowish then begin stunting in growth before eventually drying up. I found that once affected, the crop never really recovers.

The worst mistake I made was that as the crop was growing, the weeds started competing with the sweet lupin. This was because I had not done the pre-emergent herbicide before planting the seed. I thus had a “bright” idea to use a post emergent herbicide. The mistake was thinking that since sweet lupin is in the bean family, I could use a post emergent herbicide for beans. The whole crop dried up shortly after. It was painful, but a good lesson learnt. And also as the trial was done on about half an acre, the loss was not too bad.

In my second trial, I did everything right as regards the rhizobium, trianum, and proper field preparation. The crop was growing well and vigorously for the first 4 weeks. After this, I found that the fungal diseases still persisted. This was despite a spraying programme every 2 weeks with pesticide, fungicide and foliar feeding. I thus figured the fungal spray programme would have to be every week without fail. This crop of sweet lupin was very healthy and lush. The plants grew to about a height of about a meter with lots of pods. It grows like a short bushy tree.

The crop was finally ready To harvest after about 7 months. The pods are very hard and have a sharp pointed tip. Harvesting was done by hand but we had to be very careful to avoid injury. Also the pods had to be picked before getting completely dry as they explode releasing the seeds when too dry. The pods were sun-dried on a canvas before being prepared and milled and added to the cattle feed concentrates.

I found that when I used sweet lupin to directly replace soya in the dairy cows' concentrates, there was no noticeable change and milk production levels.

Would I do it again?

After growing sweet lupin and seeing what it entails to grow it, I am inclined not to try to grow it again. I think the cost of growing it is far too high from cost of seeds, to the cost of the spray programme. I would have preferred to try soya, but was advised that the altitude of the farm would not be ideal for the crop.

I also believe that other crops are better suited to my farm as protein sources for my cows. I have tried lucerne, purple vetch and desmodium all with varying success. Desmodium performs the best on my farm.

81,Agriculture,"lucerne is also known as alfalfa. It is a perennial crop that belongs to the legumes. It is good when grown as a fodder crop as it has a protein content of about 20%. As protein is one of the limiting factors in animal production, more so dairy farming, if a farmer is able to grow their own protein, they will be at an advantage.

 

We decided as a farm to try growing lucerne as the first on farm protein source. We went about researching and were able to source seeds.

 

In as much as lucerne is a very good crop and protein source when grown, establishing it is not very easy. For one the seeds require a fine tilth. This is because the seeds are quite small. Once the land is prepared, the plant requires fertile well drained soils which are not acidic. Most of the soils in Kenya tend to be acidic because of overuse of chemical fertilizers. We planted our lucerne in two seperate plots.

 

On the first plot, germination was sparse and poor. We came to find out this was because of the acidic soil. Despite ploughing and re-planting the section, the regrowth was not any better. This was also caused by the roots of the germinated plants. They emit some hormone that prevents seeds from growing.

On the other plot the lucerne established well. I think the reason for this was because the land had been fallow for a while. The crop established well and flourished. When the crop is younger, it didn't seem to have any problem, however as it started to flower and grow tall, it started to be affected by rust. This is where the leaves are affected by a fungal disease, turn brown and begin to fall off. As I live in a cool climate, this became a challenge as it meant that the lucerne would need to be sprayed with a fungicide before the flowering stage. The spraying would also need to be done about three times a year as the lucerne can be harvested 3 times a year.

 

The other problem that we found was damage by wild animals. Hares, deer, monkeys and moles were the most problematic. The moles especially destroyed the roots of the plants and dried up the plants. The others weren't as destructive as they just eat the leaves and reduce yield.

 

In terms of effectiveness, we saw and increase in milk production when fed to the cows. Since protein is usually a limiting factor in dairy production, any protein that can be fed to the cows cheaply, is a bonus. Store bought dairy supplements like soya meal, corn gluten, sunflower meal and canola meal can be quite expensive. The lower the cost of feeding per unit of milk produced, the better the margins for the farmer.

 

Lucerne is very palatable to the cows and we have never had an issue with feed intake.

 

The issues which make lucerne a problem is the fungal disease and the damage from wildlife. The fungal disease is a problem as it increases the cost of producing the lucerne because of spraying of fungicides. The wildlife damage is a problem because of how palatable the lucerne is to them.

 

Is it worth growing?

 

Lucerne is a good crop for growing as a protein source for animals as it is very high in protein and usually converts well to either animal growth, for animals for meat, or milk for dairy production.

It also is very productive under the right conditions and is relatively drought resistant. This means that a lot of crop can be harvested for either silage or baling per acre planted.

 

The only drawback for me was the fungal disease and wildlife damage. A crop like desmodium has better production and has less fungal disease problems and wildlife damage too.

Given the choice for my farm, desmodium is a better choice.

It also is very productive under the right conditions and is relatively drought resistant. This means that a lot of crop can be harvested for either silage or baling per acre planted.

 

The only drawback for me was the fungal disease and wildlife damage. A crop like desmodium has better production and has less fungal disease problems and wildlife damage too.

Given the choice for my farm, desmodium is a better choice.

79,Agriculture,"I tried my hand at chicken farming because of my love for eggs and love for its meat. It also helped that we had chicken growing up and during the holidays , I would go visit my grand mum and play with the chicken.

 

The chicken I decided to keep was the indigenous chicken and not the broiler or layer type. This was specifically because I love the flavour of indigenous chicken. I find broilers and the ex-layers to be rather bland and require a heavy hand while seasoning for any semblance of taste. I believe in rearing something that I would consume.

 



chicken in their coop 

 

I began by doing market research on how to best start my venture. After doing the pros and cons of each, I decided that starting off with day old chicks would be the better option in my opinion. At the time I felt that starting with mature hens and cockerel would take longer than I was willing to wait before the income generated was meaningful. I wanted to rear the chicken for about 8 months to a year, then when all were mature, sell as a batch. The other option would have been to have a hen(s) brood, but I felt this would be slow and hens tend to not hatch all eggs given to them. This would work against the objective of having all chicks as an age-set grow together, and thus ready for market at the same time.

 

My research led me to a few options on where to source my day old chicks. Some only sold in batches of 100, which I thought was too ambitious a number to start with. The smallest number I could start with was 50, which in my opinion sounded right for cutting my teeth into the poultry business.

 

I rehabilitated an old chicken house for the venture. Since it was mostly intact, it just required a little repair. I also sourced for wood shavings for the floor. Saw dust was readily available, but I was rightly advised that saw dust is dangerous to the chicks as they would eat it as feed and die from being unable to digest it.

 

I placed my order with the company that was closest to me and they told me I would have to wait a few days for them to be ready. As I waited I got feeders, drinkers and chick mash for my new venture. Once they were ready I was told to collect them at their depot. chicks were packed in a card board box with perforations for them to breathe.

 

I thought I had it all figured out as I got down to the business of rearing the chicks. As they say, experience is the best teacher. I had heard that at night due to the cold, I would require a heat source to keep the chicks warm. I had a raised charcoal jiko(heater) which I thought was just right. From its size I figured it would be enough for the chicks to gather around at night for warmth.

The nasty surprise waiting for me from the first morning when I was going to tend to my chicks.

I found that due to the lack of enough space for all the chicks under the heater, some had been suffocated due to crowding. I counted three dead. This experience gutted me. I however figured this as part of the experience of raising chicks. However, every day that week I woke up to a few dead chicks. By the end of that week I had lost 15 chicks. In as much as I was beginning to have serious doubts on my poultry farming abilities, I soldiered on.

 

The other thing I hadn't budgeted for properly was feed. Noting had prepared me for the amounts of feed that the chicks would eat. I would fill feeders on the morning thinking that that would be enough for the day. When I would go back to check on the in the afternoon, I would be met by shrill chirps from hungry chicks and would have to add some more feed.

 

Vaccinations also had to be done, but I had some good advise from my local agro-vet dealer who pointed me in the right direction. All were duly done and vaccination schedule followed.

 

As they were indigenous chicken, the weight gain was not as fast as broiler chicken would be. By instead of the 2-3 months broiler chickens take to get to slaughter weight, these chicken started to look ready for market at around the 6 month mark. This was where the cockerels started to get a comb and wattle. The hens started showing signs of laying eggs. As I raised the chicken semi- free range, meaning I had to supplement their feed , cost of raising the chickens was made high by this.

 

After the sixth month I started looking for market. Luckily for me indigenous chicken are loved for their meat flavour. their eggs are also preferred to the layer chicken eggs for the same reason. It didn't take me more than a week to sell of my entire flock.

 

When I did my math, I think I just about broke even with no profit to speak of. The early mortality of some my chicks early on, and added to the high cost of feeds that I was supplementing made the venture turn out as it did.

 

Would I do it again?

 

Experience is the best teacher in some of these matters. If I was to do it again, I would change the mode of feeding.

 

The cost of commercially made feeds is really high in my country. There have been attempts by many farmers to concoct their own feed rations to varying degrees of success at lowering the cost of feeding, not only chicken, but farm animals in general.

 

In my research on lowering cost of feeding chicken especially, I came across breeding black soldier fly larvae. This looks like the cheapest way to make high protein feed at a low cost to make chicken farming profitable, that I have come across. I believe once the larvae breeding setup is done, the day to day running of the process can be handled by 2 people when starting out and scaled up accordingly and still maintain profitability.

 

The video below explains how to go about it.

				© 2022 My farming Journey			"
78,Agriculture,"I love food with tomatoes. This is true for plain tomato soup. It is even more true for a meat stew which has its flavour enhanced with tomatoes to add to the flavor.

I however began tomato farming through the investment opportunity presented by agro companies that had an offer of green house tunnel farming. It is the one crop that they insisted that was a good match for growing the the green house. This was due to the fact that they started giving returns in about 4-5 months after sowing the seed.

 

I was hooked, I guess as many people who were too, by the promise of returns within 4 or so months and the constant supply of tomato fruits for about 6-7 months.

 

As this was the time i was thinking of leaving formal employment,e I visited the agro company's premises where they even had a demonstration section to show just how versatile this greenhouse farming could be. They had planted tomatoes, kales, bell peppers, kales, courgettes and other vegetables. The plants all had one thing in common, they looked positively healthy and very vivid in color and had a glorious sheen to them. Almost all the people who came to see agreed that the produce was among the best they had seen. Most had a gleam in their eyes as they prospected how they would rake in some cool hard cash once they had one greenhouse of their very own setup. I must admit I too looked like one of those cartoons who had just discovered the secret to wealth with dollar signs in their eyes.

 

I thus purchased the greenhouse kit, borrowed my relatives blue Datsun pickup and had it delivered to the farm. I had to wait another 2 weeks for the technicians from the company to be able to come and setup the greenhouse for me. During this time as I had not yet relocated to the farm, I had began my journey to being a tomato farmer, by starting to plant my seeds in trays on my balcony. I would tend to them every morning by watering mostly. When they were about 2 weeks, which coincided almost perfectly with the greenhouse setup, I transported them to the farm for transplanting.

 

I must say that the plants looked positively, the most healthy tomato plants I had ever seen. Day by day week on week they seemed to get bigger and greener. Then began the intensive bit of the work.

At first it was the pruning off of the older bottom leaves as the plants begin to got tall. When they got even taller, there was the job of setting up some support twine for the plants and trellising. Also there was the all important job of debudding some of the flowers. This was so as not to get too many small fruits, but get medium to large ones.

 

Next came the spraying regime. This was done twice a week to keep the plants healthy and ward off diseases. One was a foliar while the other was various insecticides and fungicides. For the most part the tomatoes were never affected by pests and diseases on the first run. I was happy for this.

 

Next came the picking of the fruit. The production takes the form of a bell curve. It begins with a few fruits harvested, steadily increases to a plateau, then declines after the 6th month onwards. At some point I had to decide to remove all the plants and start again. For the sake of a healthy crop, crop rotation was one of the things taught to keep various plant production up. I thus used to rotate the tomatoes with broccoli, beans, cabbage, butternut leeks and peas. It may not be a perfect crop rotation, as you are supposed to plant from the various classes of plants in succession, but at the time it worked for me.

 

The sales and marketing was a mixed bag. At the beginning, I tried selling to the local market and there was resistance at first as the tomatoes looked too”clean” compared to what they were used to. The market people were also not ready to pay a premium for , in my view, quality tomatoes. There was also competition from local farmers who were growing their tomatoes in the open field. They were prepared to offer their produce at a lower price as I guess , their cost of production wasn't that high either. As time wore on I struck a balance with the buyers who were able to offer fair price for the tomatoes. I also explored direct sales. I was able to sell directly to consumers who were not too picky on price as long as they got quality produce. This method was more profitable, but also more time consuming.

 

Conclusion

Tomato farming can be lucrative depending on where you are them and also dependent upon how many other farming ventures you are involved in.

 

The tomatoes are a very time consuming crop to tend to. They need a lot of labor to spray, prune, trellis and pick.

 

Tomatoes do better in warm climate. I live in the cooler highlands so it made sense for me to have a green house so as to be able to grow a warm climate crop, or so I reasoned at the beginning.

 

I have come to believe that there are more efficient ways to farming as compared to green house farming. These are specifically drip irrigation farming and conservation agriculture.

 

Once some pests or disease establish on tomatoes(or any other crop in a green house) it is very difficult to eliminate them. One such pest is white flies.

 

Selling produce through big retailers such as supermarkets is not very viable as they have unfavorable terms of trade which significantly reduce cash flow.

 

Would I grow tomatoes again?

Probably not. From my experience, I feel it is not worth the hassle.

				© 2022 My farming Journey			"
77,Agriculture,"At the time I was beginning my farming journey, I only had one heifer and as I needed money more immediately for upkeep as I had already quit my full time job. At the time there was one agro company that was promoting heavily its greenhouse farming as a business idea.

I, along with several other farmers and would be new farmers bought into this idea.

The dream they sold was that you could buy one kit inclusive of the greenhouse tunnel, drip lines, water tank and sees and agro inputs for a whole season. They also threw in some training for a whole day so as the very green fellows, could have an idea of best agronomy practices. The training was also to guarantee you that once you follow all that was taught, you were guaranteed an income. Said income would enable you to not only earn some profit but also completely of the greenhouse tunnel kit within a year. 

I was very excited about this venture as not only would it get me financial independence but I could already see myself as an employer. Little did I know that it was a pipe dream and not everything that glitters is gold. I, for one, didn't do any feasibility study to see how viable this business would be. And the crop of choice was tomato.

 

The problem here was that everyone was being sold onto tomato farming. Once the crop was ready the market was flooded with tomatoes. Though not all at once. I remember the first few harvest of crop were bountiful and the market price was good. People were even willing to come and collect produce direct from the farm. Things went south one time when in the local news round up, it was announced that the commodity with the highest price in my nearest town was tomatoes. I couldn't believe my luck. And just the day after I ha d harvested my tomatoes and was to sell them the next day to a local guy. I decide to take them myself to the market the next day.

I woke up early to go to the market, telling myself that the early bird catches the worm. On arriving at the market, I proudly displaying my tomatoes and awaited my produce to make me some decent money. However I noted after a little banter with the buyers who had come to market that when I quoted the price I heard on the radio, the feedback I was getting was that I was selling at a very high price. On further investigation I was told that farmers, brokers and middlemen from all over the country had Also heard the good tomato prices. Most tomatoes were ferried overnight in lorries to my town. Long story short the market was flooded and I was even lucky to get half of the announced price.

 

Another lesson I learned on this tomato farming, is that local market needs can also be a problem. With the greenhouse farming, the tomatoes are actually fairly big, and free of blemishes, as compared to the locally grown field variety. So when trying to sell my produce at the local market, most of the buyers didn't want to pay a premium for my produce. Among the reasons given were, my tomatoes being too perfect and smooth. The other being the size, that most market patrons prefer to buy many small tomatoes to see the value.

 

Greenhouse farming of tomatoes is also quite time consuming. This would be fine if the produce paid for itself. The sheer amount of work involved in pruning, trellising, picking and spraying was a lot, especially for a one man army. Because of the various issues raised above, it took me more that the one year to recoup my initial capital from the greenhouse farming venture. This also crushed my dream of it being a full time job and employing someone to assist in the running of this venture.

 

Another issue that I noted with greenhouse farming is the wear and tear of the covering material. When the kit is new the agro company actually gave a warranty of 3 or so years for parts. I was lucky that my kit started showing the vagaries of the weather from the fourth or so year. There were cases of the covering material being torn and blown off in a matter of months. The cost of repair also seemed steep for the repair of this covering material which is the main wearing part. From my research it seemed to come to about a third to a half of the initial cost of the initial setup.

 

Would I do it again?

Probably not. I blame myself for buying into the hype before doing due diligence. The cost of greenhouse farming is too steep, in my opinion, to be viable especially in the tropics. Especially for medium value crops like tomatoes. It seemed to work for a while in the flower industry in my country, though of late even that seems to be untenable. Though the reasons for the failing flower industry may be more than the greenhouse issues highlighted here.

 

Would there be a better alternative?

I believe so. In my recent years of farming, I have discovered conservation agriculture. I have seen a demo of how well it can work when done properly, especially in a semi arid area.

Drip irrigation farming is what I should have bought into in retrospect. I believe that plus some kind of mulch would be a close second in terms of efficacy to conservation agriculture.

 

Thanks for sticking around and reading my views on greenhouse tunnels.

76,Agriculture,"I got into dorper sheep also through the encouragement of my grandmother. She used to love to eat meat and mores o mutton. She maintained that among all the sheep breeds, dorper sheep had the tastiest meat. Since I have spent many a school holiday on the farm, I have seen how sheep are reared. I also have to concur with my grandmothers assertions that dorper meat is indeed among the tastiest.

 

Sheep farming in my view, is pretty straightforward. Once you plan for feed, shelter and keep up with the de-worming and vaccination programmes, it is fairly easy to raise sheep. In my case the sheep were let out to graze in a paddock. The only time feed was supplemented was during the dry season where hay and other green forage was given.

 

Sheep love salt/mineral lick. Among the farm animals, I think sheep are among the highest consumers of salt/ mineral lick. It doesn't matter whether you give it as a hard brick or powdered form. An amount of salt that would last our herd of cows a day or two would last our herd of sheep at most a day. So determined were they to have their daily dose of mineral lick, that a salt block offered no difficulty in getting as much as they wanted. When licking got tiresome, they would use their teeth to bite off bits of the block and chew it up.

 

Dorper sheep seem to put on weight pretty fast as compared to other sheep. This is a plus for farmers as they can be put up for slaughter from around 8 months onwards. Another reason why I believe dorper sheep are so popular is because of their twinning capability. Most of the sheep on the farm seem to twin very frequently. Getting an ewe birthing a single lamb is the exception rather than the norm. and even when they did get a single lamb most often than not, the next time it gave birth it would be twins.

 

Breeding is very important to keep the entire flock healthy. This meant getting a breeding ram almost every year so as to prevent inbreeding. Inbreeding causes a decrease in performance indicators of the herd, including growth rate, fertility and general health. Done correctly an ewe should give birth to a lamb (or set of lambs) twice a year. With the twinning trait, the herd can grow quite quickly in a few short years. An ewe is usually ready to breed within a year. Another advantage to dorper sheep farming.

 

Would I do it again?

 

 

With a good piece of land, and as they don't need to much as compared to dairy cows, it is one of the better sources of income (or supplement) on the farm. I wholeheartedly believe in dorper farming and would encourage anyone who has a decent plot of land to consider it. They were bred to do well especially in marginal lands, so that is another plus.

 

If you keep the dorper sheep as a flock, when they give birth it is usually around the same time. This is good for planning as also when selling, they can be sold as an age set.

75,Agriculture,"I started dairy farming (or rather owning a cow), when I was still an employee at an IT firm. This was through my grandmother purchasing some heifers for me which she considered of good heritage. This was because most of the farmers at the time didn't keep records or register their cows.

My first cow looked like a cross of Holstein and Jersey. This is because despite the black and white coat, her height tended towards the short Jerseys. Her face too looked more of jersey and had the bulging big eyes.

 

cows feeding

 

The second heifer I got was red coated and looked more of an ayshire. I didn't own this for too long as at the time it was coming into milk, my grandmother had a disagreement with one of the farm hands. He allegedly did something to the cow which meant it was not possible for the cow or him to remain on the farm. This was however before I left my job and went to be on the farm full time.

 

When I did get onto the farm, my first cow, the holstein-jersey cross breed, was in-calf. It still had a few months to go before I started getting any returns from milk. I did however get a holstein yearling which at least was of traceable lineage. It wasn't the healthiest as it had been zero grazed along with the dam. I got the feeling the farmer I bought it from was not able to get enough fodder for all his animals especially the non milk producers.

As my first problem was something that could give me returns in the short term, I got into crop farming and concentrated more on greenhouse tunnel and grew tomatoes and green peppers. Broccoli also played a big role in keeping some stream of income.

 

My first cow did eventually calf down. The calf did develop complications and had to be put down. Since I want sure about its lineage and whether the problem was due to some inherited problem, I decided to cull it. I bought an ayshire cow from my mother as a replacement. She was a better cow and served me well until she started going blind. I also had to cull her after the 4th lactation.

 

At the farm we had decided to combine efforts and also sell the milk together. This was my grandmother, mother and me. Other family members had decided to go in a different direction in terms of land use. As most cows kept were holstein and ayshire, there was a problem in terms of milk quality. The butter fat and protein content of the cows was on the lower side. To improve the quality of our milk, I decided to get some jersey or guernsey cows. I ended up getting jersey cows which greatly improved the milk quality. The customers who buy our milk could taste the difference, and we were thus able to command a premium for the milk.

 

When my holstein yearling finally calved down, she did prove that tracing the lineage of a cow is an advantage. She is and average producer and consistent with coming into heat and calving down. Her first daughter was actually my star cow. She outproduced all the cows in the herd from the first calving. This was also due to careful selection of the bull with the help of the person who was inseminating my cows.

 

Somewhere along the way I noticed that the calves being born looked small and unhealthy. I was also getting calves that died before they got to their first month. I started researching on what could be the matter. I found out that there was a high degree of inbreeding especially in the pedigree bulls that I was getting for my cows. I started thinking that in as much as this was true for the holstein breed, it probably was the same for the other cow breeds.

 

I also discovered something called hybrid vigour. This is some traits that offspring of two different breeds have over and above the two breeds from which their parents were. This can establish itself in various ways such as faster growth, increased milk production, higher fertility, longer productive life and more positive traits. I thought this was a better way to get a healthy productive heard, with less problems. I have decided to do crossbreeding on all my cows. I had 3 distinct breeds of cows, namely holstein, ayshire and jersey.

 

In as much as inter-crossing the three breeds would result in hybrids, I also read that the more different the breeds were, the better the hybrid vigour that would be exhibited. This is to mean that the three breeds are purely dairy breeds so the difference in the crosses would not that big when compared to the two base breeds. I thus researched and found of some farmers were cross breeding their dairy cows with a dual purpose breed of cow called fleckvieh. Fleckvieh being dual purpose breed can be used for both meat and milk production. They have a bulkier frame than the conventional skinnier looking dairy cattle breeds.

 

I thus embarked on my journey of crossbreeding and have gotten my first 2 generations of cross bred animals. I decided to compare the growth between the crosses and the pure bred ones and for sure, the cross bred ones look healthier despite being reared in same conditions. They also are putting on weight faster than their pure counter parts. As both generations are still under a year, I am still yet to arrive at a conclusion as regards other traits like milk production and longevity, but I can honestly say that I am so far impressed by the outcome.

 

I intend to post my views on the cross-bred cows here once they have calved down and get into milk.

 

Would I do it again?

 

I probably would do dairy farming all again. Unfortunately experience cannot be bought and you just have to earn it. Looking back if there was a way to start off with cross-bred cows I probably would do so. This is in light of the inbreeding problem which I think is a little more than what is reported. The holstein cows that for instance my grandfather kept , in my opinion, differ greatly from the ones I see nowadays, both in size and production.

74,Agriculture,"Desmodium is a vine like legume which can attain 2-4 feet in height. Its leaves look like a clover meaning they are trifoliate. Once established it has very good soil cover and is not affected much by weeds. It is good as a source of protein for animals and is also good as a cover crop in farming. It also is good for improving soil fertility as it fixes nitrogen from the air into the soil.

 

As a fodder crop, desmodium is easy to establish and maintain. Planting from seed requires a fertile well drained soil, with a fine tilth. This can be achieved easily during the onset of the rainy season or, if water is available, irrigation is also an option. Desmodium can also be propagated from cuttings, 3-5 inches is stem with a few small leaves, can be planted directly in well prepared wet soil. It has a crude protein value of about 12-20%. despite being less than lucerne, given that it produces more biomass per acre, I prefer it over lucerne.

 

My experience with desmodium has been good so far. Establishing from cuttings has been the preferred method as it is faster than from seed. It is tolerant to fungal disease as opposed to lucerne, which is not. However, desmodium is not very tolerant to drought like lucerne is. It can also be harvested about 3 times a year. The difference here being that desmodium has more biomass when compared to lucerne. Desmodium can also the easily inter cropped with other fodder crops like nappier grass, maize and sorghum. Once harvested ,it can made into mixed silage quite easily.

On the farm too, I noticed that the wildlife damage is not as bad as compared to lucerne. For this reason too, I prefer to grow it is a protein source for the dairy cows.
	"
73,Agriculture,"I tried coriander farming after talking to local farmers. I was told the herb was usually in high demand and price for the produce was great. The last clincher was that the buyer would be the one to come and harvest and pack the coriander for transportation and market.

 Harvested coriander

The first crop I planted was just a few rows in the greenhouse tunnel. Since I had never planted it before, when it was ready I put feelers out for the best way to sell the produce. A farmer in the area who was famed for his coriander farming, came by to inspect what I had. He advised me that what I had was a joke. He told me that for good returns , I needed to plant at least a quarter acre. In his view the bigger the area the better. 

He offered that if I was serious in pursuing coriander farming, he was willing to show me the ropes. He was even willing to put his money where his mouth is. A partnership was discussed. The offer was that he would buy the seed, fertilizer, fungicides , insecticides and half the labor. I was to provide the land and the other half of the labor. He projected that once the coriander crop was harvested, we would be in the money. Banking on his track record, I was hooked.

 

We first planted an acre of coriander. We had the area ploughed, then created the furrows by hand with the help of some laborers, whom we worked right next to. The seed was sowed by scattering method. When I saw this I asked him how the plant would grow and be managed if it was sowed that way. The answer was that, to covering up of the seed was then done by dragging our feet and transversing opposite the line direction. This way, he assured me over 90% of the seed ended up the the rows. I must say that when the crop germinated, I was blown away at the clean rows the coriander grew in.

Since after the initial first acre, I still had some land that was fallow, he advised that we should plant another crop in the fallow land. So that the management and marketing was staggered, he advised that we would plant two weeks later.

 

From my experience, coriander management is not too difficult. The things that must be managed is water for irrigation and fungal diseases. The fungal disease that affects the crop causes unsightly black spots which lower the marketability of the produce. Weeding was the last issue to be sorted which was controlled by use of a selective chemical agent. Urea was applied to the field once when the crop was growing. This was so as to ensure good vegetative growth.

 

The first crop went well up until the point where the weather started to change. One morning there was some really bad frost. It wiped out most of the crop. On inspecting the planted plot, there was no salvaging the situation. This was point at which I knew in farming, to never count your chicks before they hatch. I couldn't believe that all that work and effort could be wiped out in one morning.

 

The second crop did a bit better, we were more keen in the management. However, there too arose a problem. There was some rain while the crop was growing. When the rains stopped , we had to devise how to irrigate. The irrigation system I had in place was inadequate as it could only irrigate an area of about 1/8 of an acre. He had a petrol driven pump but when we connected it up, it didn't have enough power to pump water to water the crops. Long story short that crop was also a bust.

 

The harvest was a mixed bag. About half the crop was nice and green and healthy, while the other was not. The watering issued caused this outcome as it was the only aspect that we were unable to mitigate.

 

The watering issue did cause the bad price we got for the crop. It was not even enough to break even. It only covered cost of input and labor. At this point I felt very disillusioned , more so about coriander farming. There are people who still swear by it, but I feel otherwise.

 

Wold I grow it again?

 

My experience with the two trials were not good. With especially the frost issue, and as I live in the highlands, I will not be making any more attempts at coriander farming. Whether it is such a hot commodity or not. In recent times too, I haven't heard any good tidings from growing the crop. I think this may be because there was a time it was profitable to grow coriander, but as the hype grew , the opposite happened for returns as markets became saturated with it.

72,Agriculture,"Butternut squash is a type of pumpkin that has a pear shape and is a light brown or cream in colour, when mature. I began growing after talking with some market traders who told me that the butternut was popular among mothers weaning their children. It is thought to be very nutritious and a good combination with some mashed potatoes or plantain and some greens.

 

I thus figured that it would be a good plant to venture into as children are born everyday I figured. The butternut are sold per piece according to the size. Although the preference was the not so big ones. For some reason, very big size of farm produce at the local markets is not preferred. I have always wondered why this is so. Some market trader told me the larger sizes are only preferred by hotels and food eateries.

 

I found that the butternut varieties available weren't that may. I thus chose the one I could find and got to work. I did direct drilling, which is sowing the seed directly where it will grow without planting in a seedbed first. Spacing has to be done right as it is from the pumpkin family and thus they do get a lot of long vines.

 

I grew mine in the greenhouse tunnel I had as one of the plants in my crop rotation programme. As I had to maximize on space usage, I panted using similar spacing to my tomatoes. From germination, the butternut are not very fussy to grow. Other than water, the only other thing to look out for is fungal infections which affect most of the plants in the curcubit family.

 

The plant does grow fast and produces a lot of leaves and vines. I did have to prune and remove some of the vines. As I was trying to maximize on the space, the plants had to be trellised. The problem I encountered is that butternut become heavy as they mature. I had to have the fruit on the ground or have support directly beneath them.

 

The harvest was good and was ready for market in about 3-4 months. I took my produce to market. The first few times my butternut was taken by the market traders. However after 2 or so weeks, the traders took less and less of the butternut. It seems like there was a glut as I was not the only farmer that was producing the butternut. As market became a problem, I sold less and less butternut over that growing season.

 

The only saving grace of the butternut is that they have a good shelf life. Kept in a cool dry place they can keep for about 3 months. This was the point at which I figured it wasn't a good venture for regular income. I also talked to a farmer who had tried the butternut venture. He told me that he too found that marketing the produce at some point in his production cycle. It seems that it didn't have a very strong demand.

 

Would I plant it again?

 

From my own experience plus my talk with the other farmer, I would not grow butternut squash as a commercial endeavour.

71,Agriculture,"I began broccoli farming as of my crop rotation program including tomato toes, leeks, peas and beans.

I initially grew them in the greenhouse tunnel, but later also grew them as an outside crop.

 

The growing of broccoli is fairly easy as compared to tomato framing. This is more so once they have been transplanted. In the nursery stage is where they can be a bit fussy with fungal infections like damping off and being eaten by caterpillars and other insects.

 

Once sowed the plants usually germinate in about 3 days. I then usually water the seed bed daily in the morning or late afternoon. It helps if the seedbed is mulched as this allows for water retention and use by the plants. If planted in soil-less media like coco peat, the performance is usually better In terms of more uniformity in germination.

 

From germination to transplanting broccoli can take about 3 weeks. During this time other than watering, and insecticide and fungicide should be incorporated into the tending program. This is to ward off cut worms and fungal diseases of which the most devastating is damping off.

 

once transplanted and growing, the broccoli usually takes about 2.5 to 3 months to mature. I have found out that the variety matters. A hybrid variety usually has a healthier and bigger head than a non hybrid variety. The greenhouse grown broccoli also matures slightly earlier and again also has a larger head than the field grown ones. I believe the heat retention and more or less controlled conditions in the greenhouse cause this difference.

 

My experience with broccoli has been good. It seems most people know about its health benefits and is readily marketable. The other advantage is that it is bought per kilo. There is less discrepancy as opposed to selling per piece.

 

Would I grow them again?

With the relative ease of growing broccoli, I probably will continue to grow them both for own consumption and for sale. Once watering, nutrition and pest control have been taken care of, it is mostly easy to take care of.

70,Agriculture,"my great uncle and I were talking when the subject of bee keeping came up. He told me that there was a company that was selling hives and offering training on beekeeping. My interest was stirred when I found out that you can harvest honey 2- 3 times a year or even more depending on the type of hive and climate where you live.

 

The idea was to have as many hives as the surrounding areas can support. It is said that bees can go forage as far as 10 km radius from the site of the hive. That is where the environment you live in determines where and how many hives you can keep. If you live in a densely populated area, you may not be able to keep bees.

 

A Beehive

 

There is however somewhere in the city that I did see urban bee keeping. This was a property neighboring a hospital. Towards one corner of the compound, there were tall trees planted and surrounding the apiary. I've heard that this is a good strategy as the tall trees make the bees fly high when going out and coming into the hives. This reduces disturbance fro the bees to neighbors.

 

I visited a few beekeeping companies and found out what they offered and then compared. I lastly visited the national beekeeping station. Here I talked to the beekeeping experts and also got some writeup on the same. I also decided to start my beekeeping journey by purchasing two langstroth hives.

I decided on a site for the apiary along the fence of the farm, and setup the entrance of the hives facing the fence. I used to check the hives daily for activity. After about a week and no luck, I remembered some ways to “woo” the bees into inhabiting my hives. There are certain scents and smells that attract bees. The one that I could find was lemon grass essential oil. I put a few drops on a piece of cotton wool and put it the the hives.

 

The hives were inhabited within a week after that. After the bees had settled in, I gave them about a month before I added a super. A langstroth hive has boxes that stack on top of each other. The bottom box called a brood box, is where the bees setup combs with their young and some with honey. The bottom box is usually taller that the others. This is to give the bees adequate space for rearing of their young and growing their colony.

 

The other boxes stacked on top of the brood box are called supers. These are separated by a kind of mesh screen. This allows the worker bees to go up into the super and make combs of honey, but prevents the queen bee, who is larger physically, from going up and laying eggs in the super. This means that the super when full, only contains honey and makes it easier to harvest.

 

I kept inspecting the hive every 2 weeks, so as to see how much honey they had collected. Once they have filled and capped(covered) about ¾ of the combs, they are considered ready for harvest. Why this is important is because if you harvest honey at any stage before capping, even if the combs are full, there is a risk of the honey going off and fermenting because it will have a high moisture content.

 

Once I decided on the harvest day, I prepared my smoker, wore my bee suit and went to the hives. I went In the early evening so as not to cause a lot of commotion. I had once gone to my great uncles farm with my uncle. It was a half a day's journey to drive there. Once we and got there around midday, we decided to go and have a look at ,and possibly harvest the honey. Everything was set for my uncle and I except the second bee suit didn't have gloves. I was advised to wear some black paper bags to cover my hands. This I later learnt was a big mistake. Bees apparently hate the color black. Once we had opened the first hive the bees seemed to attack me more than my uncle, especially targeting my hands and the black paper bags offered no protection at all.

I had to abandon my uncle and flee for the sake of my poor hands. In my endeavour to escape the wrath of the bees, as I walked out of my great uncles farm, some herders who were looking after their cattle and goats were quick to tell me not to run in their direction. Anyway after walking about a kilometer or so, the bees seemed to abandon the chase. When I got back to my great uncle's farm, we had a good laugh about what had transpired and the lessons learnt. This was when I decided it was better and less disruptive to harvest honey in the evening, when darkness has approached.

 

The hive once opened with a hive tool to pry the cover and bars open, I cut the combs of honey into a bucket and covered, one at a time. The next step was to extract and sieve the honey which I did the next day. I must say that the honey I harvested from my hives was some of the tastiest and most fragrant I have had.

 

Would I do it again?

 

I have never stopped keeping bees. This is more so after I tasted what authentic honey tastes like. The problem with the honey especially store bought around here, is that most of it has no flavor or aroma and, in my opinion, has a watery consistency.

 

I would thus not stop keeping bees as I love eating authentic tasty honey. It may also be a good way to earn some money by selling the surplus honey.

69,Agriculture,"Avocado is a versatile fruit that can be eaten as a savoury, sweet or even plain. Either way they always taste good. Avocados are also healthy as they are a source of fat especially the mono-unsaturated fat. They also offer a good dose of other vitamins and minerals like vitamin E, C and K. They also contain magnesium and potassium.

 

Avocados are also thought to be healthy as they are offer benefits with weight loss, diabetes management, reducing cardiovascular problems and are also thought to reduce risk of cancer.

 



An Avocado tree

There are several varieties of avocado like hass, fuerte and the kienyeji/local. The first two despite being smaller in size than the kienyeji one usually taste better due to the higher fat content. The kienyeji one also is usually a purple hue when ripe.

 

I decided to grow a few avocado plants mainly for subsistence. The hass variety is the most popular here due to its nice flavour, tasty oily flesh and shorter maturity time. It also has generally higher yields as compared to the other types.

 

Caring for avocado seedlings is not very difficult. The land preparation begins with tilling to a fine tilth. The soil should also be fertile and well drained. Incorporating manure to the planting site is encouraged.

 

Water is essential for the seedling. If planted during the dry season, the plant should be watered three times a week. The water should also not be saline as very few avocado varieties are able to tolerate it.

 

When the avocado seedling is still young it is encouraged to apply some mulch. This will assist the soil in water retention a well as discouraging weeds from growing. Weeding is also essential to reduce competition for water and nutrients. Use of herbicides at this stage is discouraged as they will affect or kill the avocado seedling.

 

Fertilizer can be used to supplement the manure. CAN and DSP can be added as per your soil test results and should be adjusted upwards as per the age of the tree.

 

Most of the diseases that affect the avocado tree are fungal in nature. Scouting as well as a good preventative spray regime will reduce the effect of diseases like root rot, scab, leaf spot and fruit rot.

 

Pests can also be controlled by a scouting and preventative spray regime. The most common pests that affect the avocado plant are mealy bugs, scales and weevils. In addition to chemical methods, pheromone and biological control can be employed where possible so as to grow the avocados organically.

 

Avocado plants should be planted at a spacing of 9 meters by 9 meters apart. This should result to about 120 avocado trees per hectare. As I wast planting for subsistence, I just chose three different spots in the garden to plant.

 

This is the third year since I planted the seedlings. They have already produced flowers, though not many about three or four per plant. The last time I checked the flowers had been pollinated and had developed into small fruits.

 

This the third year and the trees have blossomed and I expect that in every subsequent year, the fruits will continue to increase. A mature avocado tree can produce between 230-320 kilos of fruit per year, according to experts in the field. I will want to see how this projected production measures up to real world experience. According to experts, avocados only become truly economically viable after the sixth year.

 

Pruning is also important to avoid very vigorous growth and have a stable, compact tree. This will help in later years to avoid a tree that is leaning or splitting due to weight of the branches, fruits and effects of the wind. Major pruning operations can be carried out after 12 years of production.

 

Avocado as a commercial venture

 

I am not an expert on growing avocado, but from my conversations with neighbouring farmers who have mature avocado trees, it is a worthwhile venture. Depending on the season and how the avocados mature, if your trees mature at the beginning or tail end of the season, there is a premium on price. Most avocado farmers in my area sell the produce per fruit. This may be due to the dishonesty of the traders and brokers who when buying per kilo, tamper with their scales to weigh less than the actual produce is worth.

 

In my opinion I believe growing avocado as a purely business venture is viable. This is more so when you can get your produce to the international market. The only hurdle being the growing, safety and handling guidelines, which must be adhered to.

Interesting.

The branch of agriculture known as “animal husbandry” concerns itself with the rearing of livestock for human use. Pigs are one of such animals that have been reared since time immemorial for their benefits—skin, gammon, bacon, and pork—to man. Thus, this article centres on the farming of pigs, mainly in a pig farm known as PIGGERY.

Many have postulated that the breeding of a pig is a more complex process than other kinds of livestock like goats, sheep, and so on. This is opined because pigs have greater sensitivity to the change in the climatic condition of the environment, and they usually require greater attention.

Nonetheless, on the advantageous side, female pigs, sows, can have about a dozen offspring in just over 4 months of pregnancy. What more, the offspring are usually ready to be sold faster than that of other reared animals.

While striking a balance between the pros and cons of pig farming, below are some important points to take note of when venturing into the world of pig rearing:

They should also be given food from plants like vegetables and corn; this is essential for their growth and development.



On the other hand, feeding of meat is not advisable, as it just increases its body’s chunk and reduces the growth level.

It is also important to note the kinds of pig farming systems available. This is so that the intended farmer can weigh his or her options and decide on which to run.

Pig farming systems are discussed below:

For such a system to run smoothly, the place should have a resistance to both dampness and heat as they can affect the health of the pigs. A structure made with concrete is very efficient for this.

Also, there should be a demarcation, in distance, between where the pigs sleep and where they feed, so that the feeding area can easily be made clean. A 3-metre width is sufficient to be used as the area to feed two pigs. Likewise, the area for sleeping can be half the area for feeding and should contain a bathing pool. With those criteria met for the intensive system of piggery, this livestock farming becomes a piece of cake.

In this system, pigs are free to roam around, but to an extent.

The necessity for running such a system is the availability of a fenced area having enough grass and soil. Fencing is needed for such an area so that the pigs do not wander too far away and get lost or stolen.

More so, the fence constructed should be one that cannot be damaged by a strong adult pig.

This is also a system of piggery that is easy to run when there is a necessary structure in place.

 

In conclusion, the rearing of pigs for commercial purposes can be a very lucrative business, as this livestock are beneficial for their pork meat and coarse hair for brushes. More so, as already noted, they breed many offspring at a time, and are highly valuable in the food market. In Europe, pigs are even used to sniff out truffles—a valuable, edible fungus. Even if the pigs are just desired as pets, they are relatively easy animals to rear, for all that it is worth.

The opportunities in Cassava farming cannot be overstated. Farm Crowdy reports that at least 1 in 10 families all over the world consumes products made from cassava daily. Cassava, now grown throughout the tropical world, is second only to the sweet potato as the most important starchy root crop of the tropics.

The areas now used for cassava cultivation are increasing rapidly because it grows easily, has large yields and is little affected by diseases and pests. The plant is grown for its edible tubers, which serve as a staple food in many tropical countries and are also the source of an important starch.

Why is this farm product in high demand? Well, here are some of the benefits:

With all these benefits in mind, let’s examine the steps required to start a profitable cassava enterprise.

On soil with depleted nutrient, fertilizers should be applied 8 weeks after planting and should be applied 6cm in width and 10cm from the cassava plant. Also, make sure the fertilizer does not touch the stem or leaves.

There you have it. If the above practices are followed to the latter, the yield can be up to 25 tons per hectare and up to 60 ton/ha for hybrid varieties. With this, you can tap into a thriving market!

thank you for this piece, I will like to venture into casava farming, but my fear is I don’t know anything about it and I don’t know how to get the buyers I will need more enlightenment please.

What a great and self comprehensive piece!

I am highly delighted to be enlightened.
Thanks!

This is the wheat farming in Kenya guide with all details on how to grow wheat in Kenya, information and answers to guide you on wheat farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial wheat farming this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into wheat farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this blogpost; How to grow wheat in Kenya

HOW TO GROW WHEAT IN KENYA

PLANTING

After maize cereal, wheat is the largest grown cereal crop. Wheat does well in places of high altitude, relatively warm temperature of about 15-22 degrees centigrade for at least 3 to 4 months and deep well drained fertile soil. Areas in Kenya favoring wheat growing include; Narok, Kitale, Nakuru, Trans-Nzoia, Uasin-Gishu, and Laikipia

Wheat varieties grown in Kenya

Before planting of wheat you should first prepare your land correctly. Land to plant wheat should be ploughed and harrowed to a fine uniform planting bed free from weeds. Use herbicides to kill off weeds.

After your land is ready and you’ve got seeds and fertilizers ready this is always 200-250kgs of DAP per Ha and seed rate of 120-140kgs per Ha. Planting of wheat is done using a seed drill. The seed drill can use spacing of 15cm between rows.

After 4-7 days germination of wheat seeds should have OCCURRED. Regular farm practices should be done to ensure maximum production this include, weeding between the 3rd leaf and tillering stage, FERTILIZER APPLICATION can also be done by using granular fertilizers.

PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL

To reduce hindrance of pest and diseases to your wheat ensure you practice crop rotation and use the necessary pesticides and insecticides. Pests and diseases affecting wheat farmers in Kenya include;

PESTS

DISEASES

WHEAT HARVESTING

Wheat is ready for harvesting after about four months but this varies according to varieties and ecological conditions of an area. Harvesting is best done mechanically using a combine harvester, where wheat heads are harvested threshed, dried and winnowed. In Kenya 1 acre of wheat farm can produce approximately 20 -100 kgs sacks of wheat proving to be a very profitable venture

WHEAT MARKETTING

Some of the best performing market for wheat from Kenya was exports to USA, Serbia, Canada, United Kingdom and Ethiopia. Locally wheat in Kenya is bought by millers at a price of 3300 per 90kg bag but this varies.

This is Watermelon farming guide full guide to enable you start and grow your watermelon farm. Whether for commercial or domestic purpose, we intend to answer all the questions regarding water melon farming in Kenya in this guide. Watermelon is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it was originally domesticated in Africa. It is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties. Wikipedia Before venturing into watermelon farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you usually ask yourself some of these questions regarding watermelon farming include:

HOW TO PLANT WATERMELON

Watermelon fruit is a warm-weather crop, with the optimal temperature being 22 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees celsius. Lower temperatures result in lower yield and quality. The watermelon crop does well in loamy, well drained soils, rich in nutrients and slightly acidic.  If grown in heavy soils, the crop grows slowly and fruit size are usually of low quality. The watermelon crop flourishes in regions with an optimum rainfall of 600mm per cropping season. Irrigation is important in order to ensure consistent moisture availability.

In order to get excellent results  from your watermelon plantation, the choice of seeds is very important.  Some of the commonly used varieties include Sukari F1, Zuri F1, Kubwa F1, Sugar Baby, Crimson Sweet, and Sweet Rose F1. Hybrid seeds are preferred for production of quality fruits. These are available in agrovets/agro dealers’ shops. 500g of seeds is required for direct sowing of watermelon in a one-acre piece of land.

Ensure land to plant watermelon is prepared properly, Water melon is spaced at 1.5metres between the rows and 1 meter from one crop to the other. The vines require enough space for their spreading. Apply DAP or TSP fertilizer at the rate of 80 kilograms per acre. This is equivalent to one teaspoon per planting home. DSP is recommended for watermelon because it’s higher amounts of phosphorus. Phosphorus is used for proper root development in watermelon. 2 watermelon seeds per hole, at a depth of 2 centimetres to 4 centimetres is recommended for planting.

After planting watermelon on the farm, regular farming practices continues. These farm practices include;

Mulching: This is done by adding materials such as grass waste beneath the soil to ensure the watermelon plant conserve moisture and also the weeds are suppressed.

Irrigation: this is done by application of water to the plants mainly in the evening to ensure frequent and adequate moisture supply to the watermelon to grow with enough moisture to increase productivity

Weeding: this is done by uprooting unwanted plants that grows with the watermelon to ensure that pest and diseases are prevented and also competition for nutrients with plants are reduced and discouraged.

VINE PRUNING

Pruning watermelons includes the removal of leaves, vines, and fruits.  This ensures that the vines focus all the energy on the few remaining fruits. When pruning watermelons, remove:

These should be removed at the junction where they connect to the main vine. Make sure you do not prune when the leaves are wet so as to prevent spreading watermelon diseases. Prune your watermelon vines, leaving a maximum of 3 vines per plant. If you need to harvest bigger watermelons, remove deformed and tiny fruits, leaving a maximum of 4 watermelon fruits per vine.

Watermelon yield varies according to the variety and general maintenance of the crop. However, an acre of land, in favourable ecological conditions and under good maintenance can produce 20 to 35 tonnes of watermelons.

PESTS AND DISEASES AFFECTING WATERMELON

APHIDS

Aphids are a major pest, causing leaves to curl and become unattractive to customers. Aphids feed by sucking plant sap. Small aphid populations may be relatively harmless, but heavily infested plants usually have wrinkled leaves, stunted growth and deformed pods. Plants, in particular young plants, may dry out and die under heavy aphid attack. Heavy attack on older plants may cause crop loss by decreasing  production. Damage may also reduce seed viability.

SPIDER MITES

The plant’s leaves and growth tips are susceptible to mites (very small, sucking arthropods) that result in twisted growth and low productivity. Generally, spider mites feeding may cause reduction in plant growth, flowering, number and length of berries, and number of seeds per berry. Damage is most severe when mites attack young plants. Mite damage may be particularly severe during the dry season.

Both organic and inorganic pesticides can be used to control pests and diseases on your watermelon vegetables, seek advice from an agriculture extension worker on pest and disease identification and management.

HARVESTING OF WATERMELON

Harvesting of watermelon starts about 3 to 4 months after planting depending on the variety and the ecological factors. Harvesting is best done early in the morning when field heat is low and the fruits are most turgid. Depending on the variety of the seeds planted your watermelons will be ready for harvesting in 80 to 120 days. Before you harvest your watermelon fruits you need to determine if they are mature and ready for harvesting, as harvesting immature fruits will lead to losses. 

MATURITY INDICATORS

 Harvesting is done by cutting the vine near the fruit. Please note that you should not pull, twist, or break the watermelon vine. Make sure you leave the stalk attached to the watermelon fruit. watermelons fruits do not continue to ripen after harvesting. If harvested when they are immature, watermelon fruits will continue to develop the red colour of the flesh,  but there will be no increase in the sugar content. This means for you to harvest quality watermelons you need to be sure that they are ready for harvesting

Watermelons fruits should not be transported in closed trucks or stored with ethylene-producing produce like bananas as this causes them to break internally, the flesh becomes water-soaked and soft and losses its sweet flavour.

WATERMELON MARKET

High demand for watermelon has provided ready market for this kind of fruit. Watermelons can be sold in;

The best way to improve clay soils is to mix organic matter well with existing soils. Bark, sawdust, manure, leaf mold, compost, and peat moss are among the organic modifications commonly used to improve soil compaction. Let’s check out more information about growing vegetables in clay soil.

The clay soil is very hard, and you may need to make some modifications before starting a vegetable garden. Clay soils contain very fine mineral particles and do not contain much organic matter. The resulting soil is quite sticky because there is not much space between the mineral particles, and it does not come out well. 

Clay soil also has some advantages. Clay, due to its density, retains moisture well. It is more nutritious than other types of soil. It is because clay particles are negatively charged, which means they attract and hold positively charged particles, such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium.

The most notable thing about clay is its density. Clay particles are smaller, many times smaller than sand grains, so wet clay feels smooth instead of being granular between your fingers. When small particles are coated with water, a slight pressure can cause them to stick together. If you can easily turn a handful of moist clay into a ball that fits well together, you probably have clay. 

Another test is to mix the soil with water in a jar and then see how the sediment forms. The clay will settle into fine sedimentary layers that feel like gloppy mud, and it will take hours for the water to clear. Due to its excellent texture, the clay soil tends to pack down, limiting the amount of soil oxygen available to plant roots and microorganisms. 

Here mulches can help, as they act as shock absorbers during heavy rains and host earthworms, which fill the air in the narrow soil with their continuous tunnel activity. When growing vegetables in clay soils, mulches reduce the natural mix and promote natural soil ventilation, increasing plant roots’ comfort.

Clay has many benefits as it is an excellent source of nutrition, but these nutrients are useless without care and attention. Shallow root vegetables can easily withstand heavy soils. They also help break down heavy clay soils. Some well-grown vegetable crops include Lettuce, Chard, Snap Beans, Broccoli, Brussels Sprouts, and Cabbage. Some of the essential vegetables that can grow well in clay soil are;

Potatoes – Potato is a vegetable that can easily grow in many soils. So, you should add this organic matter to the relatively acidic clay soil. 

In case you missed it: Rainy Season Vegetables in India

Cabbage – Clay soil is much cooler than other soils, so Cabbage is a good option for clay. 

Cauliflower – You can grow your Cauliflower in clay soil as it has a high water retention capacity. It would help if you did not plant your Cauliflower in a land where other related crops like Cabbage, Kale, Brussels Sprouts, or Turnips have been growing for the last four years. 

Peas – Peas grow well in loamy soils. They prefer soil pH of 6 to 7.5. They need to grow in both alkaline and acidic soils. Not much water is good for Peas in clay soils. Leave the roots of Pea plants in the soil after harvesting as they provide nitrogen and organic nutrients to the soil.

The best types of Cauliflower to grow in clay soil;

Pumpkins – Pumpkins are not so concerned about soil texture. However, they still need fertility. Therefore, apply a spray of well-rotted manure or compost on each hill while planting. 

In case you missed it: Growing Vegetables Under Lights: Indoor, Led Lights, Artificial Lights For Beginners

Brussels sprouts – It grows well, form strong heads in loamy soils, and like cool weather. For better yields, you should monitor soil pH and humidity. 

Squash – Both winter and summer squash perform well in all clay soils. However, add decomposed manure or lots of manure to help drain. 

Bulbs like Onions and Leeks – glow well in dry and fertile soil. Raised beds enhanced with more fertilizer are recommended. You can also add fish emulsion/compost tea to encourage rapid growth.

Bean – Bean plants do not need any special conditions for their growth. They can easily thrive in compact soil. It is essential to add fertilizer to improve the soil condition of your soil. Bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) are not picky when they are in their growing stage, and they grow in loamy soil, especially when modified with old manure. 

Temperature is the key to the successful growth of different types of bean plants in clay soils. Beans need warm soil. Because clay warms more slowly than loam or sand, wait until the soil temperature to 60F before sowing bean seeds. 

Swiss Chard – Grow Swiss Chard well in clay soil. 

Kale – Kale is preferred over clay types (sand, silt, and clay). In the preparation of soil, add old manure and aged manure. Kale also does well in clay soils, especially for cold-tolerant varieties. To increase the air inside the soil, you can dig holes. It will also help if you feed the Kale with aged manure. 

Carrots – If you grow Carrots in clay soil, you can’t find long, thick carrot stalks as it is difficult for them to penetrate the clay soil. 

In case you missed it: How to Keep Monkeys Away from Plants, Garden, Vegetables, Fruits: Tips and Tricks

With proper care, the clay soil can grow healthy vegetables. Your little effort can make the soil more friendly to vegetables. Firstly, you should work on soil aviation. Then add amendments to the soil. 

Proper aeration for soil – This simple step can bring your stubborn clay soil life. Aerating means making small holes in the soil. These holes make it possible for your plant roots to get water and essential nutrients. Another way is to add some materials like sand or soil to the soil; they will help provide oxygen to your plants. But if you have a large development area, these materials will add to your costs. 

Adding organic materials – After improving the soil texture, the next step is to add compost, manure, fish emulsion, and fertilizer. Most ingredients are readily available at home, such as fruit and vegetable peels, ground coffee, and boiling water. These organic substances provide your soil with all the essential nutrients. These materials help to create the soil fertility that most plants need. 

Add organic compost – Waste and rough organic matter is an easy addition. These include substances such as garden compost, animal waste manure, bone compost, straw, chopped leaves, and dried organic matter. They further improve the quality of aviation by eliminating defects. Whenever you plant, you want to add some old fertilizer. It helps to improve soil fertility and brings germs into the soil, thus increasing the number of nutrients. 

Mulching – Mulching is essential. Mulch will help you a lot in maintaining your sticky soil. Mulch is an excellent option if you want to maintain the moisture level in your soil. It will also help reduce weeds, a big problem for your healthy vegetable crop.

Add quality amendments – No matter what time of year, applying old fertilizer can be beneficial. The compost is full of plant matter which will help to break down soil particles. It’s also great for your plants in general and can help significantly improve their growth. Biochar is also another option. It has also gained popularity in agriculture and has begun to replace gypsum in many areas. Perlite helps block open passages for filtering water and keeps your soil well ventilated, which is suitable for breaking down plant substances such as compost.

It takes some time and patience to amend your soil but, in the end, it rewards you many times more. The first step is to add as much organic matter as possible and mix it into your existing soil as deeply as possible. Before starting, test the soil to cultivate organic matter simultaneously as lime, phosphorus, or whatever is suggested. Firstly, start using a tiller to loosen existing soil (if it is a large area). After that, spread about 2 inches of compost on the field soil and work in it. Repeat this process twice more.

Working or walking on wet mud can severely damage the structure you are trying to improve. It will take more time and care to work around existing plants. Autumn is the best time to do this as the weather is usually drier than springtime. Another reason you should do this in the fall is that the cooler temperatures are pleasant to work in and become an annual part of putting the garden to bed for the winter. Spread a few inches of compost between the plants and use a narrow jump to convert the manure into the soil.

Repeat this at least once and plant it to become part of your routine. Always work that you are walking backward and not on your freshly turned soil. In the long run, regular use of manure, fertilizers, and other organic matter will improve your soil texture, fertility, and overall health. It will be easier to uproot your plants. Choose plants that are naturally suitable for growing in the soil. It’s always better to work with what you have than try to change it completely. 

In case you missed it: Fast Growing Vegetables, Tips, Techniques

Onions grow best in well-drained and cultivated sandy, loam soils. For clay, work in compost to loosen compaction. Heavy soil does not allow onion bulbs to grow to their full potential. 

Once established, Cucumbers grow in various soils – from dense clay to light sandy loam – although all soils should be well-drained. It is good to wait for hot weather to plant cucumbers as they are sensitive to soil temperature.

The best fertilizer for clay soils is only organic fertilizer or manure. Clay soil lacks organic matter, which helps drainage and loosens the soil; use fertilizer to improve garden soil. 

Adding organic matter to the soil will help increase drainage. Just add 1-2 inches of fertilizer and put it in the soil. Adding more organic matter will help in very heavy clay soils. 

In case you missed it: Best Vegetables That Grow In Containers

Carrots like soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Prepare the site by tailing to a depth of 10 inches. If your garden is made of hard, clay soil, Wester field recommends growing carrots at least 8 inches to 12 inches high in containers or raised beds. 

Compost helps break down compacted soil that holds nutrients, water, and air together and prevents them from moving. Compost helps guide the particles that make up the soil into integrated sediment that distributes these nutrients evenly.

In Juja, a commercial and residential hub on the outskirts of Nairobi, urban farming is taking root. A good number of residents live in their own homes and compounds making it possible to engage in small-scale farming.

Joash Njani, 26, and Pramila Mwibanda, 25, have set their sights on Juja to grow their agribusiness.

The two run Urban Smart Gardeners, a business located in the cosmopolitan area through which they offer urban dwellers farming services.

The duo, who are horticulture graduates from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), started by growing various crops and selling to residents.

""Through interaction with our clients, we realised that many were willing to grow their own food but faced some challenges that include limited space, insufficient water and lack of knowledge to manage crops,"" say Ngani.

Joash Njani and Pramila Mwibanda at their Urban Smart Gardeners business premises in Juja, Kiambu County.

“This made us to start thinking of ways to grow crops in urban areas in a manner that is different. We settled on improvised gardens that are not only efficient, but also easy to manage and beautiful,” adds Pramila.

The journey began towards the end of 2020, with the duo investing Sh200,000 from their own savings and soft loans from family members into the business.

Over a year into the business, the two are happy agripreneurs, operating in Greenfields, Juja, where they run a demo hub on a 50 by 60 feet land that they lease at Sh60,000 per year. The business comprises garden units of various sizes, a seedling propagation unit, an office and ornamental plants.

“We make vertical gardens from various materials that include plastic pipes, metal and wood. We use the latter to make stands for the gardens, while the pipes host the crops and soil,"" says Pramila.

They formulate the media for growing various crops mainly from soil (20 per cent) and coconut waste (cocopeat, 20 per cent), and the remaining 60 per cent is from various organic compounds, including manure.

“The smallest of our garden, which we call a standard unit, occupies a space of a metre square and hosts 36 plants, which is triple the amount of crops grown on the ground,"" says Pramila.

The others are economy, which hosts up to 72 plants occupying 2.4 metres square space and premium, which is nine metres squared with a capacity of 240 plants. Their prices range from Sh7,500 to Sh45,000.

A plastic tank sits at the top of the gardens supplying water through the drip system.  A unit is designed with a valve, which is opened to allow water flow through the drip lines for about five minutes a day, preferably in the morning. 

Joash Njani shows an improvised vertical garden at Urban Smart Gardeners business premises in Juja, Kiambu County.

The duo say they design the gardens themselves,  and contract artisans to make some of them.

According to Njani, a variety of seedlings can be planted in the pipes, from spinach to collard greens, traditional vegletables, dhania (coriander), lettuce, thyme, sage, mint and onions.

Most produce from the gardens is harvested after four weeks of transplanting seedlings, but this is also determined by good agricultural practices observed.

Njani adds that the gardens are efficient in terms of water usage, conserving up to 60 per cent of the commodity even as it accommodates more plants.

“The system is easy to manage, since weeds do not have room to grow. The gardens are also portable,” says Pramila.

The duo, who employ three workers, have since they started worked with150 farmers, offering them garden installation as well as supplied them with garden units.

They also offer training and consultancy services on gardening, installing efficient systems, sale of gardening inputs from vegetable seedlings, planting media, fertilisers and pest control products both organic and inorganic.

Nevertheless, it is not an easy ride. They depend on hiring pickups and lorries to deliver their products, what leads to increased expenses, which they have to pass to consumers.

To begin such a business, Njani says one needs a business permit issued by the county government as well as a certification from the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (Kephis) for sale of seedlings.

John Mutisya, a farm field officer at  Biovision Africa Trust, an NGO, says vertical gardens are one of climate smart technologies that should be embraced to address food security in urban and dry areas. 

“They are a viable technology to promote agriculture because they need little space and water, are not labour-intensive and one maximises space and output.”

The Tulsi plant is one of the common plants called Basil. Tulsi or Basil plants need more heat, adequate exposure to sunlight, well-drained soil, bright light, some moisture, moisture, air circulation, and lack of watering (it takes longer to dry in winter) are preferred to be kept indoors in winter for plant care. Let’s check out how to protect Tulsi in winter season in the USA below.

Tulsi plant has many medicinal properties. It is hardy in zones 10 and 11 and can be grown year-round in the warmest parts of the United States, where it never gets cold. Tulsi plant can be grown outdoors annually or as a perennial houseplant for the rest of us. It is a heat-loving plant that grows year-round in the US Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 10 and 11. Tulsi can be grown perennially in these hot climates, but it can also be grown indoors or annually in colder climates. Kapoor Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) is mainly grown in the USA. 

Temperature / Climate – Keep your plant indoors if it is freezing outside. Do not place it near an AC vent or just under a fan. It will cause your plant to struggle to survive and eventually die. Tulsi is susceptible to abnormal temperature changes, especially extreme cold, frost, or drafts. Intermittent or prolonged exposure to cold can result in Tulsi leaves turning brown, new leaves spoiling, or stunted growth.

As an herb traditionally grown in tropical climates, Tulsi does not tolerate cold well and will be damaged if its temperature drops below 10°C. Tulsi will also react badly if the temperature drops too much at night. If you periodically move it to a new environment and plant it in warm soil, you can save the plant from getting cold. 

Humidity – To control humidity, you can moisten the Tulsi plant by watering it. It will help the Tulsi plant in the dry cold.

There is no need for a soil type for this plant that can be grown in any soil except those extremely salty, alkaline, or waterlogged. It prefers to grow in sandy loam soils with good organic matter and is considered ideal. Longer days and higher temperatures are ideal conditions for a Tulsi plant to grow well. Soil plays an important role, try to keep the soil well-drained; if it stays moist for a long time, it will encourage rot and root rot. 

Apply a balanced liquid fertilizer once every four weeks but reduce the fertilizer after the growing season. It is also beneficial to replace a two-inch layer of soil with compost every year or six months. Fertilizer plays an important role in the Tulsi plant growth, so if the plant is in the container, it must give fertilizer. 

The soil in the container has a very limited source of nutrients, so we always have to fertilize the Tulsi plants every 25 to 35 days to grow faster and absorb all the nutrients from the soil in the pot. 

In case you missed it: How to Grow Tulsi from Seeds: Soil, Plant Protection from Cold, Indoor, and Outdoor Growing Tips

So, we have to decompose the Tulsi plant with organic manure, i.e., vermicompost or cow dung or leaf manure; cultivate 1 to 2 inches on the top layer of soil, and then we can add our organic manure to it. And after fertilizing, water can be added so that the Tulsi plant can absorb nutrients from the soil. It is good to give organic fertilizer as we will use Tulsi leaves, an organic fertilizer will help better plant growth, and the growth will be longer.

Prune Tulsi plant as needed throughout the year to control its size and promote better and more compact growth. Leaf pruning or slight pruning helps the plant survive before entering from the outside. Use a sharp knife to dig into the roots to help the plant transfer nutrients from the roots. Remove dried leaves in the winter season. 

Check the positioning of the Tulsi plant – If you are wondering how to save the Tulsi plant from dying in winter, you should know that Tulsi cannot survive the cold. Please keep the Tulsi plant in a place where you can get sunlight. 

Check the watering schedule and pattern – You should also watch your watering schedule. Ideally, you should examine the top layer of soil (approximately 2 inches). If the soil is dry, water the Tulsi plant carefully. Giving too much water can rot the roots, while drinking water underwater can make the leaves greasy. 

Prune regularly – You need to prune your Tulsi plant regularly to keep it alive. It helps in removing dead parts or affected parts of the plant. Pruning helps in circulation and access to sunlight in all plant areas for better growth.

Fertilize properly – You should fertilize your Tulsi plant every fortnight. It will help your plant recover as it will have access to important nutrients. You can also add cow dung manure, tea leaves, and dried leaves. 

Get rid of pests – Occasionally, you should also use pesticides. If you see pests attacking your Tulsi plant, you can use chemical pesticides or make pesticides at home. 

In case you missed it: Growing Tulsi Organically – Cultivation, Farming

You need to understand that every plant has different water needs, and you cannot water them in the same way. It is a common mistake to water people carelessly while growing a Tulsi plant, which may be why your Tulsi plant is dying. You may be over-watering or under-watering. Before watering your Tulsi plant, dip your finger into a 1–2-inch pot of soil to see if it is dry. If it feels damp, don’t water it. 

Watering the Tulsi plant is enough to make the soil and not fill it with water. If the Tulsi plant leaves turn yellow, you water them too much, and the roots may start to rot. Let the soil dry completely and then re-water it, and never let the soil get wet. If the Tulsi leaves turn brown, you may be taking the plant underwater. 

In case you missed it: Basil Pests and Diseases (Tulsi); Control Methods

Give less water to the Tulsi plant in winter. You should water the Tulsi plant when the top 2-3 inches of soil is completely dry as there is not much evaporation during the winter and most of the water stays for a long time. If you water the soil carelessly every day in winter without checking it, its roots may start to rot. 

The Tulsi plant needs less water in winter than in summer. But too much-wet soil can weaken them. And, gradually, they will die if you do not take immediate precautions. But if you take care of them before they get hurt, you can save them from dying. 

The most common causes of Tulsi leaf browning are more or less watering, temperature pressure, insufficient light, pests, or diseases. Brown leaves on Tulsi are usually signs of a plant health problem and should be addressed as soon as possible.

In general, it is free from pests and diseases. However, when grown in poor conditions, it can be attacked by common insects like mealybugs, aphids, spider mites, and sometimes whiteflies. To treat pests, use organic pesticides or insecticide soaps. Although Tulsi is a very hardy plant, some insects can attack it. These include aphids, spider mites, thrips, and scales, all of which suck the plant sap and its leaves turn brown. 

It would help if you inspected Tulsi plants regularly to find pests. Carefully inspect both sides of the plant leaves and along the stems. Yellow spots on the leaves may form irregularly, or the whole leaf may be brown or yellow. Gardeners can treat them either by spraying pesticides on the plant with oil or soap or by using predatory insects such as ladybugs or weevils to rid the plant of the offensive insects. 

The best way is to spray good quality neem oil on the affected leaves with a few drops of soapy water and save your Tulsi plant from dying. Also, remember to never spray pesticides (in this case, neem oil) in the presence of sunlight, as this will burn the leaves. Always apply pesticides and insecticides in the evening. Do not spray it regularly and wait at least 21 days before spraying again. 

In the growing season, cut the aromatic leaves of your Tulsi plant. Once your plant reaches a height of 8 inches, take a pair of scissors and cut a large leaf or a whole branch according to your needs. Use fresh leaves on the day you harvest because they die quickly. When the Tulsi plant reaches a height of about one foot, you can start harvesting Tulsi. 

In case you missed it: Tulsi Oil Extraction Process, Benefits, Uses

To help develop the habit of a shrubby plant, remove the growing points, which will increase the yield. It should be ready for harvest about 40 days after germination and perform best with intermittent pruning. The Tulsi plant can continue to produce for many years if planted slowly with leaves or branches. 

This variety of sacred Tulsi grows well in our sub-tropical climate, especially in Central Florida. According to mint family specimens, Tulsi has a square stem with opposite leaves and small flowers arranged along a raceme atop the plant.

Easily propagated by seed or cutting, Tulsi has grown annually in most of the USA, but it will grow as a perennial in hot climates and as an indoor plant under the right conditions. 

Tulsi leaves curl in response to environmental pressures such as unbalanced water, poor soil, improper lighting, and temperature fluctuations that shock and impair its growth. Fungal diseases and sap-sucking insects such as thrips and aphids also weaken and damage the leaf structure. 

Overwatered Tulsi will initially produce yellow, yellow leaves, often starting upwards from the lower leaves. Wilting the leaves soon follows, and you may notice an unpleasant odor from the soil. The soil will get wet, and if you remove the plant from the pot, the roots will turn brown and brown or black. 

In case you missed it: Tulsi Farming Project Report (Basil), Cultivation Economics

Tulsi leaves appear damaged by too little sunlight, certain diseases or pests, or too little water. A healthy Tulsi plant needs to identify the cause and correct it. 

Use light, well-drained soil rich in organic matter, although holy Tulsi will tolerate poor soil well. Your plant will tolerate some shade, so full sun is not necessary. Water it, but do not get wet, and prune the leaves as needed, as you would with a typical sweet Tulsi plant.

Commercial goat farming for dairy and meat production in Kenya is growing rapidly and is contributing significantly to national income, economic growth, and improved human nutrition. Goat farming has become very popular among small-scale farmers in urban and densely populated areas of Kenya. Let’s check out more information about goat farming in Kenya.

Many people want to start an agribusiness without passing through much stress. If you are looking for a livestock farming business in Kenya that can earn you good cash without any pressure, take a look at the goat farming business in Kenya. The growing pasture population, human activities, and the weakening of traditional rules governing the use of resources have reduced the productivity in northern Kenya, which has led to a shortage of chevon and mutton in Kenyan markets. 

The goat farming business is common in Kenya, especially in rural areas. People raise goats for wool, milk, and meat. Goats are very tough and some breeds can withstand the weather. What people choose for their goat breed depends on their location and climatic conditions. Dairy goat farming in Kenya has doubled in recent years as interest in the project has grown among most of the country’s farmers. This is because consumers prefer goat’s milk over other cattle’s milk because of its nutritional and easily digestible properties. In addition, dairy goat farming is emerging as a more profitable option for small farmers in Kenya. 

In addition to cow meat, goat meat is another type of meat that is popular in Kenya. And that’s because of its unique taste or aroma. Kenyan love nyama choma, especially goat meat. In addition, goat meat is very nutritious. So let me conclude that many Kenyans eat goat meat every day and this will lead you to the excitement of starting your commercial goat farming in Kenya. 

In case you miss this: Common Mistakes in Goat Farming: For First Time Goat Owners

Goats can be housed in a variety of systems depending on the availability of land and labor. These systems are intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive production systems. 

Intensive system, also called zero-grazing, is a system of keeping goats where goats are kept. Goats are provided fodder and water. In the intensive system, the mating is controlled, where the farmer can decide which bucks and does mate and the time for mating. This ensures that there is no crossbreeding and flock multiplication is controlled. 

Under the extensive system of dairy goat farming, goats are allowed to graze under their feed, under the care of a herdsman. It works well where there is no soil problem and there is suitable vegetation for goats. To ensure that goats get a balanced diet, goats should be given nutritious food and mineral salts. Housing is provided for dairy goats so that they are safe and comfortable at night. Under this system, each goat needs 1 square meter of space. This means it can hold 200 goats instead of 20 by 10 meters. 

In case you miss this: Common Mistakes in Goat Farming: For First Time Goat Owners

The semi-intensive system of dairy goat farming is a combination of both intensive and extensive systems. The goats are left to graze and are also provided with feed and water. In some cases, make goats are zero grazed, while does (female goats) are grazed. Though, the does are brought to the bucks for mating. 

Unlike some livestock farms such as chickens, fish, and livestock, the goat is an animal that never chooses weather conditions. And most of all, Kenya’s climate is perfect for raising goats in any state. 

Raising goats in Kenya is a lucrative project if all needs are taken into account. Goat’s milk production in Kenya is lower than that of cow’s milk. Goat’s milk yields more per liter than cow’s milk. A dairy cow needs half an acre of Napier grass to raise, while it can raise 5 goats. In addition to keeping goats for milk, there are other value-added products such as goat’s milk yogurt, and cheese. Goat farming is a profitable business in Kenya. Make market research that is in high demand and you will get more benefits and go into it. 

For example; A healthy and mature goat can weigh about 35-40 kg (therefore, the price of a goat should be about 7,000 Ksh or more. And suppose you have about 100 goats in your goat farm, you would be selling for about Ksh 700,000. Let’s say the cost of feeding and labor is up to 100,000 Ksh, yet you can earn up to 600,000 Ksh every year. So, goat farming is a good investment, although no business can make you rich overnight. 

In case you miss this: Dairy Disease Symptoms and Treatment for Cows, Cattle, Goats, and Sheep

Meat goat farming is becoming more and more popular in Kenya. This is because they can be kept in dry areas and are hardy. The goats are reared in a short time, the gestation period is shorter, the extra kids are more likely to need more space, and the cows need less space. They are also very easy to invest considering the initial capital investment and the time you need to participate in them.

Construct a suitable house for your goats. The house should;

You can divide the housing management into two parts;

Resting or sleeping area – Make the goat’s sleeping area comfortable enough with good ventilation facilities, soft bedding, a wall with a door, a nice roof, and there should be a well-ventilated system. 

Feeding area – The feeding area consists of a feed rack, slatted floor, water trough, and rainproof mineral block pack area. Ensure adequate flow of fresh air and light in goats’ sleeping and grazing areas. 

Because goats are browsers, not grazers, a house 1.5 feet above the ground will look more attractive to them. It also helps reduce food waste. A house of 1.8 m * 1.8 m * 2.5 m (5.5 ft * 5.5 ft * 8.5 ft) is suitable enough for housing 10 small goats.

This is the profitable tomato farming in Kenya definitive guide with all information and answers to guide you on tomato farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial tomato farm or tomato farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into tomato farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW TOMATOES IN KENYA

PLANTING

Consider the following actions and ecological requirements for tomato farming, soil should be deep well drained loam soil, water should be available in the area where tomatoes are to be planted if not consider the installation of water tanks, the area where tomatoes are to be planted should be gently sloping land. It is also important to note that tomatoes cannot be planted immediately at the land where potatoes or peppers have been planted. Tomatoes are normally grown from seedlings.

 We now step into the next step which is seedlings preparation.

TOMATO NURSERY

Prepare a raised nursery bed of 1 m width and to the length of your convenience, add farmyard manure and mix with the soil on the nursery bed. Prepare furrow like lines across the nursery bed with a suitable spacing between rows now sow the seedlings from the sachet and cover with uniform light soil. During this period mulch the nursery bed as continuous watering and weeding continues until the period of transplanting. Mulch can be removed as soon as the seedlings appear around 8 to 10 days. Transplanting to the actual land is done after 4 to 5 weeks

Transplanting is done in the evening where seedlings are uprooted from the nursery with a lump of soil in their roots. Seedlings should be planted in a well prepared land free from weeds. Holes in the actual field should be with spacing of 60 to 45

Plant the seedlings with a handful of compost or farmyard manure, phosphate fertilizer can be applied at the base for root development and CAN fertilizer can also be used as a top dresser to aid in leaf development

Flowering of tomatoes begin at 5 weeks after transplanting

FARM PRACTICES FOR TOMATOES

As your tomatoes continues to mature on the farm regular farm practices continue

TOMATO SUPPORT. This is done by using light poles on each plant where tomatoes are tied using a string to follow the poles upwards. This increases productivity of tomatoes, avoid stem damage during support

PRUNNING: this is the removal of side shoots and suckers also yellow and wilted plants should be pruned

Soil conditioning: This is done by application of manure to the soil this is done in moderation too much nutrients or too little nutrients may damage your tomato plantation

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your tomatoes. Weeds harm the proper growth of the tomatoes

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in potatoes making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

PESTS AFFECTING TOMATOES INCLUDE: American bollworm, DISEASES: Tomato blight, Bacterial wilt, Blossom end rot.

By following the farm practices of tomato farming, within a matter of weeks your tomatoes should be growing vigorously and rapidly.

HARVESTING OF TOMATOESwhen the tomatoes produce ripe fruits first harvesting is ready this is always at 70 days after planting depending on variety and ecological conditions. To facilitate proper harvesting of tomatoes, fruits should be picked carefully to avoid damaging the plant.

MARKETTING

After successfully harvesting your tomatoes you are now ready for marketing after storage in crates. Tomatoes are sold in kilograms to various market around Kenya

An acre of tomato plantation can produce up to 30 to 35 tons of tomatoes under good maintenance and 1kg of tomato 2021 in Kenya costs up to 150-300kshs which varies according to time and availability. This should proof how profitable is tomato farming in Kenya.

There is always ready market for your tomatoes in Kenya you can market tomatoes in schools and institutions, fast food chains, hotels and open air markets.

terrace cultivation,  method of growing crops on sides of hills or mountains by planting on graduated terraces built into the slope. Though labour-intensive, the method has been employed effectively to maximize arable land area in variable terrains and to reduce soil erosion and water loss.

In most systems the terrace is a low, flat ridge of earth built across the slope, with a channel for runoff water just above the ridge. Usually terraces are built on a slight grade so that the water caught in the channel moves slowly toward the terrace outlet. In areas where soils are able to take in water readily and rainfall is relatively low, level terraces may be used.

Terrace cultivation has been practiced in China, Japan, the Philippines, and other areas of Oceania and Southeast Asia; around the Mediterranean; in parts of Africa; and in the Andes of South America for centuries. See also paddy."

agricultural technology,  application of techniques to control the growth and harvesting of animal and vegetable products.

Mechanical processing of soil so that it is in the proper physical condition for planting is usually referred to as tilling; adding nutrients and trace elements is called fertilizing. Both processes are important in agricultural operations.

Tillage is the manipulation of the soil into a desired condition by mechanical means; tools are employed to achieve some desired effect (such as pulverization, cutting, or movement). Soil is tilled to change its structure, to kill weeds, and to manage crop residues. Soil-structure modification is often necessary to facilitate the intake, storage, and transmission of water and to provide a good environment for seeds and roots. Elimination of weeds is important, because they compete for water, nutrients, and light. Crop residues on the surface must be managed in order to provide conditions suitable for seeding and cultivating a crop.

Generally speaking, if the size of the soil aggregates or particles is satisfactory, preparation of the seedbed will consist only of removing weeds and the management of residues. Unfortunately, the practices associated with planting, cultivating, and harvesting usually cause destruction of soil structure. This leaves preparation of the seedbed as the best opportunity to create desirable structure, in which large and stable pores extend from the soil surface to the water table or drains, ensuring rapid infiltration and drainage of excess or free water and promoting aeration of the subsoil. When these large pores are interspersed with small ones, the soil will retain and store moisture also.

Seedbed-preparation procedures depend on soil texture and the desired change in size of aggregates. In soils of coarse texture, tillage will increase aggregate size, provided it is done when only the small pores are just filled with water; tillage at other than this ideal moisture will make for smaller aggregates. By contrast, fine-textured soils form clods; these require breakage into smaller units by weathering or by machines. If too wet or too dry, the power requirements for shattering dry clods or cutting wet ones are prohibitive when using tillage alone. Thus, the farmer usually attempts tillage of such soils only after a slow rain has moistened the clods and made them friable.

Some soils require deepening of the root zone to permit increased rate of water intake and improved storage. Unfavourable aeration in zones of poor drainage also limits root development and inhibits use of water in the subsoil.

Tillage, particularly conventional plowing, may create a hardpan, or plow sole; that is, a compacted layer just below the zone disturbed by tillage. Such layers are more prevalent with increasing levels of mechanization; they reduce crop yields and must be shattered, allowing water to be stored in and below the shattered zone for later crops.

Equipment used to break and loosen soil for a depth of six to 36 inches (15 to 90 centimetres) may be called primary tillage equipment. It includes moldboard, disk, rotary, chisel, and subsoil plows.

The moldboard plow is adapted to the breaking of many soil types. It is well suited for turning under and covering crop residues. There are hundreds of different designs, each intended to function best in performing certain tasks in specified soils. The part that breaks the soil is called the bottom or base; it is composed of the share, the landside, and the moldboard.

When a bottom turns the soil, it cuts a trench, or furrow, throwing to one side a ribbon of soil that is called the furrow slice. When plowing is started in the middle of a strip of land, a furrow is plowed across the field; on the return trip, a furrow slice is lapped over the first slice. This leaves a slightly higher ridge than the second, third, and other slices. The ridge is called a back furrow. When two strips of land are finished, the last furrows cut leave a trench about twice the width of one bottom, called a dead furrow. When land is broken by continuous lapping of furrows, it is called flat broken. If land is broken in alternate back furrows and dead furrows, it is said to be bedded or listed.

Different soils require different-shaped moldboards in order to give the same degree of pulverization of the soil. Thus, moldboards are divided into several different classes, including stubble, general-purpose, general-purpose for clay and stiff-sod soil, slat, blackland, and chilled general-purpose. The blackland bottom is used, for example, in areas in which the soil does not scour easily; that is, where the soil does not leave the surface of the emerging plow clean and polished.

The share is the cutting edge of the moldboard plow. Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow.

Moldboard-plow bottom sizes refer to width between share wing and the landside. Tractor-plow sizes generally range from 10 to 18 inches (25 to 45 centimetres), although larger, special-purpose types exist.

On modern mechanized farms, plow bottoms are connected to tractors either as trailing implements or integrally. One or more bottoms may be so attached. They are found paired right and left occasionally (two-way), with the advantage of throwing the furrow slice in a constant direction as the turns are made. A variation is the middlebreaker, or lister, which is a bottom equipped with both right- and left-handed moldboards.

The disk plow employs round, concave disks of hardened steel, sharpened and sometimes serrated on the edge, with diameters ranging from 20 to 38 inches (50 to 95 centimetres). It reduces friction by making a rolling bottom in place of a sliding one. Its draft is about the same as that of the moldboard plow. The disk plow works to advantage in situations where the moldboard will not, as in sticky nonscouring soils; in fields with a plow sole; in dry, hard ground; in peat soils; and for deep plowing. The disk-plow bottom is usually equipped with a scraper that aids in pulverizing the furrow slice. Disk plows are either trailed or mounted integrally on a tractor.

The rotary plow’s essential feature is a set of knives or tines rotated on a shaft by a power source. The knives chop the soil up and throw it against a hood that covers the knife set. These machines can create good seedbeds, but their high cost and extra power requirement have limited general adoption, except for the small garden tractor.

The chisel plow is equipped with narrow, double-ended shovels, or chisel points, mounted on long shanks. These points rip through the soil and stir it but do not invert and pulverize as well as the moldboard and disk plows. The chisel plow is often used to loosen hard, dry soils prior to using regular plows; it is also useful for shattering plow sole.

Subsoil plows are similar in principle but are much larger, since they are used to penetrate soil to depths of 20 to 36 inches (50 to 90 centimetres). Tractors of 60 to 85 horsepower are required to pull a single subsoil point through a hard soil at a depth of 36 inches. These plows are sometimes equipped with a torpedo-shaped attachment for making subsurface drainage channels."

This is the profitable sweet potato farming in Kenya definitive guide with all information and answers to guide you on profitable sweet potato farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial sweet potato farming or farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into sweet potato farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW SWEET POTATOES IN KENYA

PLANTING

Sweet potatoes are drought tolerant tuber crops it is usually in different colors the main being red, purple brown and white. Its vines are normally used as fodder. Sweet potatoes are normally grown in nearly every part of Kenya. Sweet potato varieties grown in Kenya include Zaparo, Naspato, Tainain, Kemp. Sweet potatoes can be consumed whole- boiled, roasted, deep fried or mixed with cooked beans, mashed and consumed as a complete meal. The tuber can be made into chips, crisps or dried and ground into flour

The suitable ecological requirements for growing of sweet potatoes are 750- 100mm rainfall although sweet potatoes can withstand dry conditions, it is important to have rain during the first week of planting this helps in root development. Sweet potatoes are grown from vine cuttings or storage roots. Vine cuttings is mostly preferred because it develops better roots, produces high yields and are free from soil borne diseases.

Vine cuttings should be free from fungal and any kind of diseases, length of 30cm is recommended. Leaves should always be stripped off from the lower area of the vine cuttings

The area where sweet potatoes are to be planted should have deep well fertile soil. If the soil is infertile ensure to mix the soil with manure. When the land is ready, Create raised mounds 6 to 8 inches tall and about 12 inches wide, base diameter of 30-40cm. Plant 3-4 vines in single stand at equal distance from each other.

PLANTING SWEET POTATOES ON RIDGES

On ridges make ridges 1m apart and the base of 1 ridge to the other to be 10-15cm the vines are planted on left and right position of the ridges at 30cm between plants within rows and 50-60 cm between rows.

The seed rate for sweet potatoes is cuttings 27,000 per ha (11,000 per acre).

The first weeding of sweet potatoes is done after 2 weeks upon [planting

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in sweet potatoes making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

SWEET POTATO DISEASES

SWEET POTATOES PESTS

HARVESTING OF AWEET POTATOES.

Sweet potatoes mature after 100days of planting this is when the sweet potatoes root tuber is long and tapered with a smooth skin. Harvesting is done by loosening the soil around each plant to avoid injuring the tubers. You may also Cut away some of the vines before doing this.

Pull up the plant’s primary crown and dig up the tubers by hand. Handle the sweet potatoes carefully, as they bruise easily. 

Shake off any excess dirt and do not wash the roots. Curing can then be done on the harvested sweet potatoes by leaving them on strong sunlight. This gives the sweet potatoes a sweet tasting flavor

With good management and depending on variety of the sweet potatoes, you can achieve up to 38 tons/Ha although average yields ranges between 15-30 tons/Ha. This proofs how profitable sweet potato farming in Kenya is.

Storage of sweet potatoes can be on crates or sacks.

MARKET OF SWEET POTATOES IN KENYA

Sweet potatoes can be exported or sold locally in markets, supermarkets and institutions. Sweet potatoes fetches better prices in major urban markets like Mombasa and Nairobi.

This is the Sukumawiki farming in Kenya comprehensive guide to enable you start and grow your Sukumawiki for domestic or commercial purposes. Sukumawiki in other words known as Kale is a common vegetable grown in Kenya. It is common because it is mainly served with the staple food ugali. Sukumawiki is a green vegetable with wide leaves. Before venturing into Sukumawiki farming in Kenya there are a variety of questions you have asked yourselves, we intend to guide you on Sukumawiki farming and answer all these questions here.

HOW TO GROW SUKUMAWIKI IN KENYA

Sukuma wiki vegetable requires well-drained fertile soil high in organic matter and soil with PH of 6.0 to 7.0. It is also important to note that Sukuma wiki can tolerate slightly alkaline soil. Nearly every household in Kenya consume Sukumawiki as a vegetable hence raising the market demand for this kind of vegetable. There are various varieties of Sukumawiki grown in Kenya listed below

PLANTING

Sukuma wiki is first sown in nursery beds before transplanting. Nursery beds for Sukuma wiki are created by raising soil and creating Furrow like lines to sow seeds which are then covered with thin soil. The nursery bed should be properly taken care of by watering twice daily and mulching is also preferred to conserve the moisture on soil.

For about a period of four to five weeks when the seedlings have produced true leaves, transplanting can be done to the actual planting field or land. The land to be transplanted to should be ploughed and harrowed so as to bring the soil to fine tilt and to avoid hardpans which may hinder the growth of Sukumawiki roots and the plant development

On the land where the kales or Sukumawiki are to be transplanted dig holes to a spacing of 30 by 30 cm in uniform rows and columns. You should allow spacing between rows that one can pass when handling the Sukumawiki plants. On those holes add farmyard manure while mixing it with soil. When planting in the rainy season go on with transplanting the Sukumawiki seedling one in each hole then cover it firmly with soil.

In a period of minimal or low rainfall, transplant the seedlings at the evening period and after application of manure add water in each hole while you repeat the same step of planting mentioned above.

After transplanting your Sukumawiki on the farm regular farming practices continues for a period of about two weeks when the vegetables have adapted. These farm practices include;

Mulching: This is done by adding materials such as grass waste beneath the soil to ensure the kale plant conserve moisture and also the weeds are suppressed.

Irrigation: this is done by application of water to the plants mainly in the evening to ensure frequent and adequate moisture supply to the kale plant.

Weeding: this is done by uprooting unwanted plants that grows with the Sukumawiki to ensure that pest and diseases are prevented and also competition for nutrients with plants are reduced and discouraged.

HARVESTING OF SUKUMAWIKIafter around 4 weeks of transplanting your Sukumawiki vegetables with proper care you will have noticed that your kales have attained maturity. This is when the leaves have grown rapidly. You can now harvest your Sukumawiki by manually picking using your thumb. Keep in mind that it is important to only harvest the outer leaves so that the inner leaves can continue to grow and allow you to continue harvesting your crops.

MARKET

High demand for Sukumawiki vegetable has provided ready market for this kind of vegetables. Sukumawiki can be sold in;

Sukumawiki can yield up to 8000kgs per acre if you follow the well laid guidelines on this site

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SUKUMAWIKI FARMING IN KENYA

After around 4 weeks of transplanting your Sukumawiki vegetables, with proper care you will have noticed that your kales have attained maturity. This is when the leaves have grown rapidly. You can now harvest your Sukumawiki by manually picking using your thumb. Keep in mind that it is important to only harvest the outer leaves so that the inner leaves can continue to grow and allow you to continue harvesting your crops.

Sukumawiki as a vegetable is not a complicated plant to grow and with necessary organic farmyard manure you can use to successfully manage the nutritional value of your soil, if you can’t access this I highly recommend you to use DAP fertilizer

Sukumawiki germinates very faster as seeds but for about a period of four to five weeks when the seedlings have produced true leaves, transplanting can be done to the actual planting field or land

COLLARD SUKUMA WIKI by (Simlaw select) is a collard variety with leaves that are tasty, tender, mild & juicy. It is a vigorous and hardy variety. It is relatively tolerant to adverse weather & soil conditions. It is a non-heading type that grows 2-3 feet & bolts slowly and tolerates heat and poor/sandy soils. It matures in 45 days you can get 10 grams from any agro store at 150 kshs

Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) is a widely grown family Gramineae (Poaceae) crop. Sugarcane is a significant source of sugar in all tropical and subtropical countries. It is the most environmentally friendly crop, requiring minimal fertilizers and pesticides. It gets most of its necessities from the rich, moist soil of the region. Let’s check out more information about Sugarcane farming in the USA below.

Sugarcane fields not only produce food but also provide valuable habitats for animals. Sugarcane is a thick-growing member of the grass family with a high content of sap or juice. It is tender to cool, the tops being killed by temperatures just below freezing. In the United States, where freezing can occur during the winter, it is mainly planted in the late summer or early autumn season and is harvested one year later. However, it can be grown almost any time in tropical countries as the plant does not have a resting period. 

The active growth season lasts 7 to 8 months in the continental United States, while growth continues until harvest in the tropics. It results in heavy production of Sugarcane and sugar in tropical conditions. In Hawaii, for example, Sugarcane and sugar yields per acre, where Sugarcane is grown for about two years before harvest, are 3 to 4 times higher than a season’s growth in Louisiana and Florida. In addition to contributing to the national exchequer, it directly or indirectly employs more than one million people. 

In excluding Puerto Rico, production in the United States averaged 2,550,000 tons – from 592,000 acres in Hawaii, Florida, and Louisiana. Puerto Rico’s sugar production averaged 850,000 tons in two years. The largest producer of Sugarcane in the United States is Florida, followed by Louisiana, Texas, and Hawaii. Louisiana Sugarcane harvesting usually begins in October. However, the farmer should keep one percent of his farm planted with new seed Sugarcane annually. Before harvest, it is essential to plant, but rain and muddy conditions can delay planting. 

In the United States, planting Sugarcane will provide the best chance of success in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 9-10, including parts of Florida, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Texas. Sugarcane grows in furrows (or trenches) that you make in nitrogen-rich soils. Growing Sugarcane requires living in tropical climates like Hawaii, Florida, and Louisiana. It is produced in limited quantities in Texas and a few other Gulf coastal states.

In case you missed it: Top 24 Steps to Boost Sugarcane Yield: How to Increase Production, Size, and Quality

Since Sugarcane is all hybrid, Sugarcane is sown using stems obtained from the mother plant of a suitable breed. These, in turn, sprout, creating clones that are genetically identical to the mother plant. Because Sugarcane plants are so diverse, the use of seeds for breeding results in plants different from the mother plant, so plant breeding is used. Although there is a growing interest in developing machinery to reduce labor costs, the planting process usually occurs from late August to January. 

Sugarcane fields are replanted every two to four years. After the first year’s pruning, the second round of stalks, called ratoon, grows from the old. After each harvest of Sugarcane, the field is burned until the yield level decreases. The field will be plowed at that time, and the ground will be prepared for a new crop of Sugarcane plants. Sugarcane care is completed with cultivation and herbicides to control weeds in the plant. Sugarcane plants often need extra fertilizer for optimal growth.

Sugarcane production must be relatively close to the sugar factory to be profitable. There are government policies that limit the amount of sugar produced in the United States but support the price farmers receive, thus limiting the expansion of Sugarcane. Sugarcane is now harvested mechanically in the United States. 

In factories, Sugarcane is crushed to extract sugar, and the juice is boiled and then separated into sugar crystals for further processing and grinding. The stalk that remains after crushing is known as bagasse and is often burned at the factory to generate electricity but can be used to make paper, building boards, plastics, and mulching or animal bedding.

Planting is done by digging a shallow furrow and laying the canes end-to-end. The cane is then covered with mud extracted from the furrows. Sugarcane can also be grown in North Florida during March. Before the large-scale sweet market, almost every field had a patch of Sugarcane. As a result, sugarcane accounts for 62% of the world’s sugar. Currently, Sugarcane is grown on about 440,000 acres in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), making it one of Florida’s most widely grown row crops. 

Production occurs mainly on land near or the southern half of Lake Okeechobee. Most Sugarcane production is in Palm Beach County, but Sugarcane is also grown in Hendry, Gladys, and Martin counties. About eighty percent of the crop is grown on highly organic soil and 20 percent on the sand. About 50% of the sugar produced in the United States comes from Florida, making up about 20% of all sugar (Sugarcane and beetroot) used. 

Florida’s sugar industry employs more than 14,000 people with an annual income of over $ 800 million, and the total economic value (with direct and indirect effects) is over $ 2 billion.  Sugarcane is Florida’s most valuable farm crop, worth more than the combined price of the Corn, Soybean, Tobacco, and Peanut crops are grown in Florida. The crop ranks 3rd in Florida’s agricultural economy behind the greenhouse and Citrus industries. All of Florida’s Sugarcane goes to one of the five mills that operate in South Florida. 

Corporate farmers make up about two-thirds of Sugarcane, while cooperative mills make up the rest. Raw sugar is transported to refineries by road, rail, or ship or is sold in its raw state. Sugarcane is a giant grass that grows in the sun, rain, and fertile dung of South Florida. Sugarcane is grown from late August to January. Sugarcane is harvested between late October and mid-April. 

In case you missed it: Best Fertilizer for Sugarcane: Organic, Biofertilizers, NPK, Compost Manure, and Schedule

Sugarcane can be grown as a hobby crop for syrup production or for “chewing cane,” but in South Florida, Sugarcane is grown commercially for crystal or white sugar production. Sugarcane production in Florida is concentrated in and around Lake Okeechobee. Palm Beach, Hendry, and Glades are counties in South Florida where Sugarcane production is particularly important. However, sugarcane is grown in all parts of Florida.

However, the commercial Sugarcane industry is located near the southern tip of Lake Okeechobee in South Florida. Palm Beach County produces the most Sugarcane (70% area and 75%-ton weight). The rest is grown in the adjoining counties of Hendry, Glades, and Martin. While most Sugarcane is grown on manure soils, about 20% is produced on sandy mineral soils. 

Louisiana’s 22 parishes produce Sugarcane on more than 400,000 acres – producing approximately 13 million tons annually. Sugarcane production and processing in Louisiana employs approximately 17,000 jobs – and the state boasts 11 raw sugar factories. Louisiana Sugarcane harvesting usually begins in October. However, the farmer should keep one percent of the farm planted with new seed Sugarcane annually. Before harvest, it is essential to plant, but rain and muddy conditions can delay planting. 

Sugarcane requires fertile, well-drained soil and an abundant moisture supply for successful growth. It has a long growing season that allows it to withstand short-term droughts. Late spring or early autumn freezes can dramatically affect production and quality. Irrigation is not common in Louisiana but is sometimes done on some farms during long dry periods. In normal years, irrigation is not required due to heavy rainfall. Louisiana Sugarcane harvesting usually begins in October. 

However, the farmer should keep one percent of his farm planted with new seed Sugarcane annually. Before harvest, it is essential to plant, but rain and muddy conditions can delay planting. In Louisiana, the largest Sugarcane-growing state, Sugarcane production is largely confined to the Mississippi River Delta, where the soil is fertile. However, the sugar industry has spread north and west to non-traditional Sugarcane growing areas in Louisiana. 

Sugarcane expansion has largely come at a time when profits from competing crops, such as Rice and Soybeans, have declined. Louisiana production has also increased because of the adoption of higher-yielding varieties of Sugarcane and investment in new harvesting combinations. The Sugarcane varieties are grown to some extent in Louisiana are L 01-283, L 01-299, L 03-371, HoCP 96-540, L 99-226, HoCP 00-950, HoCP 04-838, Ho 05-961, Ho 07-613, HoCP 09-804 and L 11-183.

Sugar quickly became a major business, and the island’s population grew rapidly, with 337,000 people displaced over a century. The need for Sugarcane labor reinforced immigration that gives Hawaii its multicultural background today, and the effect of early afforestation formed the basis of our labor laws. In addition, the demand for sugar water led to the construction of wide canals, the emptiness of rivers, and the development of the most exclusive water rights in the country. 

Texas is the fourth largest Sugarcane producer in the United States, with 1.5 million tons grown on 40,000 acres per year. The economic impact is over $ 200 million and provides hundreds of permanent jobs in a region where employment opportunities are far below the state average. The Sugarcane industry in Texas is located in Cameron, Hidalgo, and Willis counties in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV). 

It is the fourth largest source of American Sugarcane. Sugarcane is produced on 43,000 acres with an annual harvest of 1.5 million tonnes. Texas Sugarcane grows in the lower reaches of the Rio Grande Valley at the southern tip of the state. The region has a subtropical climate – long, hot summers and short, mild cold. Killing freezes are a recurring threat, and hurricanes and droughts have significantly reduced yields over the years. 

Sugarcane should be consistently moist in well-drained soil but not wet or over-watered. If you do not live in an area with heavy rainfall, it will need extra irrigation. A dry spell will be helpful to slow down the growth in the lower part of the stalk and increase sugar production. Sugarcane needs high temperatures and sunlight for maximum growth. Most Sugarcane cultivation cannot withstand temperatures below freezing or freezing. 

In case you missed it: Organic Sugarcane Farming, Production Practices

Sugarcane that grows in cold conditions can cause the leaves to turn brown and wither and the plant to die during prolonged frosts. However, if you live in hot climates, you can grow Sugarcane outside. Sugarcane needs the following things to survive and thrive.

Sugarcane has been successfully cultivated for decades in the Imperial Valley of California. The soil is rich in relatively deep loam. It is well suited for farming, with the availability of irrigation water due to the preferential allocation of water from the Colorado River basin by the Imperial Valley. The area is known as one of the most productive agricultural areas globally.

Due to the dry climate, irrigation, and intense sunlight, Imperial Valley Sugarcane can be planted year-round, unlike in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, where the rains limit the harvest season to six months. 

Sugarcane is propagated vegetatively. It is also a perennial crop. After the first crop, called “plant cane,” is planted, regrowth or “ratoon cane” is harvested each year until the condition of the plant deteriorates. An average of three annual crops are harvested until it is replanted. When replanting (late August to January), some parts of the mature Sugarcane field are reserved for “seed cane.” 

The material is divided into stalk pieces that are planted according to the condition of the plants. They are applied after two to four years. Sugarcane stalks are cut by hand into seed pieces, laid out in twin rows horizontally in the field, and covered with soil three to eight inches deep. Sugarcane is harvested from late October to mid-April. Sugar production is usually higher because the weather is cold.

Sugarcane harvest at the best time in South Florida; it is necessary to harvest some fields before the Sugarcane plants reach their maximum productivity. The fields are burned to remove farm waste, and then mechanically harvested Sugarcane is loaded onto trucks and transported to the mill. 

Insects and mites that feed on the Sugarcane crop in Florida can increase production costs and reduce yields. However, Sugarcane cultivation is relatively resistant to pests common in semi-tropical environments. Sugarcane’s pests include wireworms, white grubs, Sugarcane borers, lesser cornstalk borer, aphids, and Sugarcane rust mite. 

In case you missed it: Sugarcane Seed Germination, Time, Temperature, Process

An integrated pest management (IPM) program with several balanced components will provide effective borer control and increase profits without harming the environment. The most important part of the IPM program for Sugarcane borers is regular scouting. Recommended control options include biological agents, planting varieties that are resistant to infection and damage, planting borer-free seed pieces, and pesticides. 

Harvesting of Sugarcane in Hawaii and Louisiana is highly mechanized. The machines lift the canes to the same height, cut them to the ground, and collect them in rows. In Florida, Sugarcane is mainly harvested by hand. Leaves and trash are burned in rows by flamethrowers. An alternative way is to burn the leaves with standing Sugarcane, after which it is cut and taken directly to the mill. In both cases, the delay between cutting and milling should be as short as possible as the delay results in a loss of sugar content.

Machines are being developed to cut, clean, and load the Sugarcane to be transported directly to the mill. In the United States, where winter frosts are a threat, Sugarcane harvesting should begin early to maximize yields. When plants are killed by freezing, the loss of sugar is rapid. Although such plants are suitable for extracting sugar if harvested immediately after freezing, it may not be possible to cover large areas. 

In non-mechanized areas, the knife is still used to cut, and the leaves are removed. But, then, this is a difficult and time-consuming task. In general, farmers harvest from one plant for 3-5 years. Once the cane is cut, the rotating arms take off the leaves and their growth and pass the stalks through a cutter that cuts them into small pieces. 

It grows in warm climates and can be found even in the southern parts of the United States; Texas is one of those states and was an essential part of Sugarcane in East Texas, usually south of the center of East Texas. In addition, it is widely grown in southern Louisiana. 

Sugarcane cultivation in Florida is usually done with mechanical harvesting of burnt Sugarcane. 

Climate, soil suitability, and proximity of mills limit production in this region of the state. However, it has a long growing season that allows it to withstand short-term droughts. 

In case you missed it: Ring-pit Method of Sugarcane Cultivation

About three-quarters of Sugarcane is grown and processed into sugar, which is used to make bread, canned fruits and vegetables, beverages, cakes, candy, cereals, ice cream, and other foods. The rest is packaged in large industrial or family-sized bags to be sold directly to consumers.

Growing Sugarcane requires living in tropical climates such as Hawaii, Florida, and Louisiana. Also, it is grown in limited quantities in Texas and a few other Gulf coastal states. Since Sugarcane is all hybrid, Sugarcane is sown using stalks obtained from the mother plant of a suitable breed.

This is the guide to subsistence farming with all the details you need to know about subsistence farming, who uses subsistence farming, subsistence farming practices, types of subsistence farming, examples of subsistence farming and many more on subsistence farming

Subsistence farming: Subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow food crops to meet the needs of themselves and their families on smallholdings. Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements, with little or no surplus.  Wikipedia

Characteristics of subsistence farming

Advantages of subsistence farming: One of the benefits of Subsistence Agriculture is that it is cheap and cost effective. No requirement of huge investments as would otherwise have been needed by a commercial farmer is the prime reason for its cost effectiveness. The tools, kits and implements that are used are easy to obtain and mostly not expensive.

Types of subsistence farming

Water management in subsistence farming

Simple tips to keep moisture in the soil

Keep soil moisture: During dry periods, some soils are more and some are less in a position to supply crops with water. The ability of a soil to absorb and store water largely depends on the soil composition and on the content of organic matter. Soils rich in clay can store up to three times more water than sandy soils. Soil organic matter acts as storage of water, just like a sponge. Therefore, crop residue or a cover crop protects the soil, prevents crusting on the surface, and slows runoff. Roots, earthworms and other soil life maintain cracks and pores in the soil. Less water runs off, and more sinks into the soil.

Reduce evaporation: A thin layer of mulch can considerably reduce the evaporation of water from the soil. It shades the soil from direct sunlight and prevents the soil from getting too warm. Shallow digging of the dry top soil can help to reduce the drying up of the soil layers beneath (it breaks the capillary vessels). A better retention of water within the soil saves costs on irrigation.

Better use of season’s rainfall: Ripping during the dry season allows farmers to plant earlier – right at the start of the rains

52,Agriculture,"Spinach is a cool weather crop that doesn’t grow well in hot summer months when the days are long. The best temperature for growing spinach is between 16ºC and 24ºC.

Step 1: Loosen your soil by digging down deep.

Step 2: Apply fertiliser, manure or compost. If you are using fertiliser, use one handful for every square metre of soil. Or four hands of kraal manure or compost for every square metre of soil.

Step 3: Use a garden fork to mix soil and fertiliser, manure or compost thoroughly, and then even out using a rake.

Step 4: Put the seed or seedlings into the ground, working according to the instructions on the seed packet or the nursery recommendations.

Step 5: Water the plants regularly. Use flood irrigation, a sprinkler, a watering can, a hosepipe or drip irrigation.

Step 6: For a better crop, apply a top dressing about five weeks later as spinach needs a lot of nitrogen for good quality, broad leaves. For this top dressing, use either chicken manure or LAN applied between the rows and work it in lightly. Remember to remove weeds regularly.

Step 7: Harvest spinach regularly. Remove only the outer (older) leaves with a sharp knife about 30mm to 50mm above ground level. Don’t damage the new leaves. If the leaves are not going to be used immediately, bunch them and put them in water to keep them fresh for longer.

Step 8: Don’t plant spinach on the same plot over and over, because this causes spinach pests and diseases to build up in the soil. Rotate the crop with other vegetables such as pumpkins, beans, peas, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes and cabbage.

Soybeans are one of the most widely grown and used legumes in the world due to the valuable components of their seeds. It is key for growers to get the most Soybeans per acre to profit with Soybean prices rising. To maximize Soybean production, farmers need to maximize their management. Let’s check out the steps to boost Soybean yield.

Management practices that may affect crop growth include seed preparation, variety selection, planting rate, planting depth, row width, pest management (diseases, pests, and weeds), and plants, including nutrition and harvesting. Soybean production can be enhanced by adopting the right methods and technologies for better crop management and system improvement. To get maximum yield, farmers are advised to adopt the system-based method of planting. 

Such a comprehensive agricultural management program includes cultivation methods, cultivation choices, and the use of herbicides, fungicides, and pesticides. The growth, development, and production of Soybeans result from the interaction of different genetic potential with ecological and farming methods. Reducing environmental pressure will improve seed production. 

The secret to successful Soybean production, from planting to harvesting, lies in keeping your plants healthy. Proper planning and good planting management are essential to ensure maximum yield. Factors that affect Soybean production and classify them according to their effects on yield;

Some factors, such as weather and growers, are out of control, but they must always be held accountable. As genetics and management practices improve Soybean production, more N may be needed to maximize potential production.

The number of nodes determines seed yield per plant because the number of flowers is genetically determined and does not change much. 

According to the following, proper selection of Soybean varieties is essential for success in high-yielding, management-based production systems. The seed variety has a special effect on yield, and the variety that achieves full maturity for the area leads to the highest yield increase. Many factors affect the choice of farming. 

In case you missed it: Organic Soybean Farming, Production Process

The soil pH is important because it directly affects the availability of nutrients in the soil to the plant. Soil pH measures the acidity or concentration of hydrogen ions in a soil solution. Many chemical and biological soil processes are affected by pH. Maintaining a proper pH will maximize the efficiency of other crop inputs and reduce the risk of yield loss. The optimum pH range for maximum Soybean production is 6.0 to 6.8 (in mineral soils). 

Maintaining proper soil pH levels ensures nutrient availability and maximizes productivity. Good soil structure is essential for good root growth and development – Soybeans are sensitive to soil compounds. Distance with plant density and crop rotation will help increase Soybean production by reducing the incidence of diseases, pests, and weeds. Pest and disease control minimizes damage to root and leaf areas. 

Soybeans require a temperature of about 15 to 32°C for germination for rapid growth, but the crop requires high temperatures for rapid growth. The best type of harmful soil is sandy loam which has a good amount of organic matter. 

Choosing the right variety for your acre is the most important thing a farmer can do to improve yields. Unfortunately, this is also one of the most difficult steps because there is no single reliable source of information. It is important to choose a variety with herb tolerant properties, variety maturity, agricultural properties, disease, and pest resistance. Choose varieties and maturity groups with the most productive capacity and genetics and trait packages suitable for your situation and methods.

As always, the biggest impact on any crop is something over which we have no control, but we can reduce weather effects with proper planning. Ideally, you want to plant Soybeans as early in the season as possible in late April or early May. Because Soybeans are a mildly sensitive crop, this timeline allows the plant to flower during the longest days of the year, from late June to early July, which will increase the pod set. 

In case you missed it: Soybean Seed Germination, Time, Temperature, Process

Variety selection is one of the important management decisions affecting Soybean yield. Soybean growers need to compare performance results from various sources, locations, and environments. A common mistake is to look only at local data (your farm, neighborhood, county, etc.). Local statistics, despite being interesting, provide only a glimpse of how well this variety of Soybeans performed in a narrow area last year. 

Comparing different types of performance in many different environments and factors will give farmers the best forecasting ability for next year’s environment. Farmers are constantly reminded that their first production decision is the type they plant. Always choose a high-yielding variety with the necessary agricultural and defense package and is suitable for the field and soil where you will be planting it. 

Many varieties like JS 93-05, JS 95-60, JS 335, JS 80-21, NRC 2, NRC 37, Punjab 1, and Kalitur have been developed with high seed longevity. Varieties like MACS 58, NRC 37, Type 49, Durga, and Punjab 1 have been developed, suitable for mechanical harvesting with the lowest entry point of the lowest bean. In India, scientists have developed MACS 1407, a high-yielding and pest-resistant Soybean variety. 

Planting various Soybeans to diversify plant genetics can be a good strategy to reduce the risk of crop damage due to stressors. However, the timing of harvest and frost should be considered. Once a group of high-yielding Soybean varieties has been selected, the next decision is to select varieties that meet specific disease, pest, and weed resistance/tolerance characteristics, keeping in mind the specific fields. Using traditional cross-breeding techniques, they developed MACS 1407, which yields 39 quintals per hectare.

There are frequent field and soil samples to determine their status and long-term patterns and trends for productivity, fertility, soil health, drainage and water management, disease, pests, and weed pressures. Many companies now offer field satellite images. Consider past and present crop production and management practices and discover new ideas and technologies for continuous improvement. 

In case you missed it: Soybean Cultivation Income, Project Report

Knowing your land and how you cultivate can better anticipate new methods, opportunities for improvement, and specific short-term needs that will ensure maximum profits. Start with a clean field. Early season grass control is another essential ingredient for high-yielding Soybeans. 

You don’t want to lose any yields with herbs, so starting with a clean field is important. It can rarely be accomplished using a postemergence herbicide application strategy. Using an early pre-emergent, residual herbicide also helps provide a large window for a later post-emergent application. 

The effect of plant stress on Soybean plant dehydration or drought Is susceptible to yield loss in two major stages due to stress – germination and reproduction – seed development. Soybeans should grow about 50% of their weight in water and develop radicle and hypocotyl, primary root and shoot tissues. Seeds planted in dry soil or not planted in the soil will not be able to absorb water unless there is adequate rainfall. 

Some farmers have overlooked their pH levels and P&K applications with low commodity prices. Soybeans respond to lime when the pH is less than six and eat too much potassium. Soybeans need nutrients and water. Nutrient seed dressing is designed to provide essential nutrients in the right shape and proportions to aid early root development. 

Early and large-scale root formation is important for plant health and driving production. A broad, healthy root system results in the spread of the root surface. The higher the root level of the Soybean plant, the more nutrients and water it can absorb. It is highly productive and beneficial in dry conditions. 

Proper nutrition is key to maximum yield. Soybean yields will decrease when it is deficient in essential nutrients. Increasing fertilizer efficiency and availability produces more Soybeans per acre with less fertilizer. Soybeans need plenty of nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and phosphorus (P). 

Soybeans require about 4 to 4.5 pounds of N is produced per bushel, half of which comes from their nitrogen-fixing nodules and the rest from the soil. The 60-bushel crop eliminates significant nutrients with grains, especially N, P, and sulfur (S). Phosphorus and potassium nutrients are important for high-yielding Soybeans. Maximize your economic profits by using phosphorus and potassium fertilizers on Soybeans. 

Crop protection is essential, for which high-quality seed treatment is essential. Seed treatment can help protect against soil-borne diseases and pests. Defending against nematodes and protecting against sudden death syndrome are very important in our area. To get a high yield, less than 30-inch rows are useful. Also, the best seed rate to maximize yields is to cut 100,000 plants/acre. 

To increase profits, improve planting equipment and seed condition so that the seeds planted per acre do not exceed the required level to achieve this final position. Narrow rows of or less allow plants to quickly canopy and receive more sunlight for photosynthesis, with the added benefit of shading the soil to reduce weed competition. That narrow rows can improve yields to about 8.5 bushels per acre under a top management system. 

Effective weed control is essential for plants to reduce the adverse effects of light, water, and other essential elements. Weeds can be controlled through management, and mechanical and chemical control. Soybeans should be controlled within the first four weeks after emergence for weeds that have germinated to prevent a decline in yield. Before planting, the growing weeds should be killed by seed preparation. 

In case you missed it: Soybean Farming Information Detailed Guide

Soybean seeds need to be well-connected to the soil so that the Soybean foliage will shade out weeds. Deep-growing plants grow more slowly than shallow-growing plants. Leaving a coarse seed in the middle of a row of seeds will reduce weeds. Narrow rows allow Soybeans to shade bushes more quickly.

Whitefly, tobacco caterpillars, hairy caterpillars, and blister beetles are some of the pests that can attack the Soybean crop, and proper pest control methods can be used to protect them. Significant damage caused by Soybean aphids, Soybean diseases like Phytophthora root and stem rot, sudden death syndrome, white mold, and Soybean cyst nematodes can be reduced by choosing resistant or tolerant varieties. 

The variety is your best choice for managing these pests. Disease and pest control are essential to maintain productivity. Using a combination of fungicides and pesticides, a significant portion of the Soybean leaf is retained to block sunlight and maximize seed filling. 

When the leaves turn yellow, and the pods are dry, the crop is ripe and ready for harvesting. Harvesting can be done by hand or with a sickle or threshing machine. Harvesting the crop at the appropriate stage through the threshing machine. Symptoms of maturity – leaf drop, leaves turn yellow, seed moisture content 15%.

This is the Comprehensive sorghum farming guide to enable you start and grow your sorghum for domestic or commercial purposes. Sorghum and also known as great millet, durra, jowari / jowar, or milo, is a grass species cultivated for its grain, which is used for food for humans, animal feed, and ethanol production. Sorghum originated in Africa, and is now cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical regions Before venturing into sorghum farming in Kenya or anywhere there are a variety of questions you have asked yourselves, we intend to guide you on sorghum farming and answer all these questions here.

HOW TO GROW SORGHUM IN KENYA

Sorghum is produced in a wide range of soil types and agro-climatic zones. It does well in heavy clay soils (vertisols) and light sandy soils with a pH ranging from 5.0-8.5. Sorghum crops grow best in warm areas. They are grown on a wide range of soils. Sorghum is sensitive to nematodes, especially on sandy soils, and therefore sorghum must not be grown continuously on its own nor in a close rotation with maize.

 There are various varieties of sorghum cereals grown in Kenya listed below

PLANTING

Land preparation for sorghum should start promptly after the previous crop is harvested. This allows adequate time for; infiltration and storage of soil moisture, the decay of crop residue and soil firming. For optimum production of sorghum, the row spacing for sorghum is between 60-75cm by 20cm between plants depending on the variety. In places where an ox is used to plough the land and the row spacing is fixed at 90cm, the recommended plant spacing is 15cm.

Fertilizer application is done at the rate of 2 bags per acre at planting. When the crops get to knee-height, it is recommended that you top dress the crop using CAN.

Basal fertilizer is broadcast and incorporated by disking before planting can commence. The common practice of planting is broadcasting seed on a well ploughed land (with fine tilth) and covering lightly using a light harrow, roller, bush drag by cattle over the lands and covered to a depth of 2-3 cm. Mechanical planting using seed drill can also be done but this will require high seed rates and will require more labor for thinning

After planting your sorghum regulars farm practices continues which include;

FARM PRACTICES FOR SORGHUM FARMING

Thinning

Sorghum should be thinned ,Thinning should be done to establish an in- row spacing of 15-20 cm and this should bedone before tilling begins and is normally done 4 weeks after emergence This ensures proper air circulation within the crop, promoting sufficient performance.

Irrigation

If the soil is not moist enough, (which could be due to inadequate rainfall), supplemental watering should be done. At flowering stage, enough moisture for the sorghum should be ensured.

Weeding

Weeding of sorghum is done by uprooting unwanted plants that grows with the sorghum to ensure that pest and diseases are prevented and also competition for nutrients with plants are reduced and discouraged. Sorghum can be intercropped with legumes such as beans and cowpeas. Intercropping of sorghum and cowpeas helps in weed and pest control as cowpeas act as a trap crop

SORGHUM PESTS AND DISEASES

Diseases1. Leaf Blight: This is common in southern Africa, and is favored by moderate air temperatures and wet conditions or heavy dews. Dry weather retards the disease. Rotation with non-susceptible crops (non-grasses) aids in destruction of infected residue thereby reducing the level of primary infection.2. Downey mildew: Infested seedling leaves are chlorotic, stunted and pre-mature death may result. Use of Seed Co resistant varieties is the smartest control method3. Smut: Ear head becomes swollen and turn grey. Use of Seed Co resistant varieties is the smartest control method

PESTS

Maturity period of sorghum is at 90 to 120 days depending on variety and ecological conditions. Harvesting is normally done when plants reach physiological maturity. Leaves will be turning yellowish and beginning to dry up naturally. Harvesting of sorghum should be done early to avoid losses from birds, insects, mold and bad weather. The ideal time to harvest sorghum is when the moisture content is below 20% as the seeds will have hardened enough to withstand threshing action. You can harvest sorghum by cutting the head using a knife. You can alternatively use a combine harvester if a large tract of land is to be harvested

After harvesting sorghum ensure to dry to 12% moisture content before storing.

SORGHUM MARKET

High demand for sorghum crops has provided ready market for this kind of cereal. Sorghum can be sold in; Currently, the cost of a 90kg bag of sorghum ranges from Ksh.3000-5000

The suitable seeding rate for sorghum seeds size of sorghum cultivars varies from 30 000 to 40 000 grains per kilogram. Recommendations therefore, vary from 3.0 to 7.0 kilogram seed per hectare. Sorghum is normally planted with maize planters.

slash-and-burn agriculture,  method of cultivation in which forests are burned and cleared for planting. Slash-and-burn agriculture is often used by tropical-forest root-crop farmers in various parts of the world, for animal grazing in South and Central America, and by dry-rice cultivators in the forested hill country of Southeast Asia. The ash provides some fertilization, and the plot is relatively free of weeds. After several years of cultivation, fertility declines and weeds increase.

Then, as traditionally practiced by indigenous peoples and subsistence farmers, the area would be left fallow and reverted to a secondary forest of bush. Cultivation would shift to a new plot. After about a decade the old site could be reused. Such practices can be considered sustainable, as they do not require outside inputs such as synthetic fertilizers, and small clearings can recover as forest over time. (See also shifting agriculture.)

By the early 21st century, however, cleared areas were typically maintained in a deforested state permanently, causing habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss. Although traditional practices generally contributed few greenhouse gases because of their scale, modern slash-and-burn techniques are a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, especially when used to initiate permanent deforestation. Forests sequester carbon in the form of wood and other biomass as the trees grow, taking up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When forests are burned, their carbon is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that is altering global climate (see global warming), and the trees are no longer present to sequester more carbon. In Southeast Asia, slash-and-burn agriculture for oil palm cultivation has been a major source of annual air pollution from smoke. Although this form of agriculture is strongly associated with the deforestation of tropical rainforests such as the Amazon, slash-and-burn practices are also responsible for the loss of large areas of tropical dry forests, where the dry season permits a better burn."

This is the full guide to answer your question how to make silage at home. By the end of this article you will be able to fully learn how to make silage at home and all your questions about silage making will be answered. Before making silage these are some of the common questions you have been asking yourself:

What is silage?

Silage: is a type of fodder made from green foliage crops which have been preserved by acidification, achieved through fermentation. It can be fed to cattle, sheep and other such ruminants (cud-chewing animals). Silage is usually made from grass crops including maize, sorghum or other cereals. Silage can also be made from many field crops

Why make silage/ importance of silage making

There are various reasons why you should make your own silage as a farmer. Whether you are a dairy farmer, sheep farmer or just a business person, silage making has many importance

1st STEP

Make a shallow pit on a ground area with sloping terrain and ensure it is sloping inside from the higher to lower side in a wedge like shape. The size of the shallow pit you are making will depend on the amount of silage you are willing to make, in a snippet you can use this measurement to make your pit: 2cubic meter pit holds 1000 kilograms or 20 bags of fresh chopped forage materials. This will also take approximately 2000 liters of molasses and 10 meters of polythene sheeting

2nd STEP

The forage to be ensilaged either maize, grass or any other forage material should be chopped to the length of about 1inch using a panga. Remember to chop the forage uniformly.

3rd STEP

This is the step where you carefully insert the polythene into the pit to cover ground and side area this is with aim of avoiding the forage to get in contact with the soil.

After doing this you can now empty 1 bag of forage onto the pit covered by polythene and spread uniformly. Repeat this process until you have filled the pit to 1/3 full

4th STEP

After you have filled your pit with forage up to 1/3 full now it’s time to add molasses to the forage, the measurement for this is; 1 liter of molasses with 3 liters of water. Sprinkle the mixture evenly to the forage. This is useful as the solution helps feed the microorganisms to make the silage acid quickly and to prevent rotting

5th STEP

Now it’s time for you to drive out air from the forage this is done by compressing the forage by either using a heavy drum or using your feet. Driving out air from the forage will prevent fungi attacking and destroying the forage. After doing this you can now repeat the process of adding the chopped forage and sprinkling it with the molasses solution while compressing until you attain a doom shape in the filled up pit.

After you have completed the process you can now cover the prepared forage with polythene to prevent water and dig in a shallow trench around the pit to drain off water.

6th STEP

Cover the pit with soil up to a layer of 24 inches in case the material used was wet and still fresh but when the material used was more dry forage, cover to 36 inches this is to protect the polythene used to cover the forage from damage.

7th STEP

The conservation of materials by microorganisms takes a couple of weeks, thereafter it can be fed. With good sheeting and enough soil on it the ready silage can be kept well for 1 to 2 years

8th STEP

Harvesting of your silage is done by uncovering the silage from the lower end where you can only remove enough material for feeding for a short period then cover the rest until it’s used up. A cow can estimate use 20 kg silage daily. Silage offers a very safe feed for dry season and ensures constant supply of milk from your dairy farm or dairy business

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

The conservation of materials by microorganisms takes a couple of weeks, this is approximately 15 to 20 days and can be stored for a longer period of time without losing quality

Small-scale farmers can use the method of making silage from grass clippings, molasses and other fermentable carbohydrates. By using grass clippings, molasses and a more or less airtight container, small-scale farmers can make their own silage conveniently

Silage is fermented and stored in silo before used as food or feeds and in Storage methods: Hay is mowed, dried and stored in bales. Silage is compacted and stored in air-tight conditions without being necessarily dried

To achieve high-quality grass silage, it is crucial to harvest pasture grass at the preferable time of maturity (55-70% moisture content). Maize is a common silage crop wherever it can be grown successfully likewise, Silage is usually made from grass crops including maize, sorghum or other cereals. Also silage can be made from many field crops

Silage of poor quality has slimy soft texture when rubbed from the fiber or leaf and contains molds. Very dry or even brittle breaking like biscuit silage shows the material ensiled had too high dry matter content and there was overheating during storage causing much detrition this can be used to determine the signs of bad silage follow the procedure above to correctly make your own silage.

This is usually caused by the growth of clostridia bacteria in the silage. These organisms produce acid in forage, which smells like rancid butter. Clostridia bacteria normally live in manure and soil, and often their spores are present on forage.

shifting agriculture,   system of cultivation that preserves soil fertility by plot (field) rotation, as distinct from crop rotation. In shifting agriculture a plot of land is cleared and cultivated for a short period of time; then it is abandoned and allowed to revert to its natural vegetation while the cultivator moves on to another plot. The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or, more commonly, when the field is overrun by weeds. The length of time that a field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed to regenerate by lying fallow.

One land-clearing system of shifting agriculture is the slash-and-burn method, which leaves only stumps and large trees in the field after the standing vegetation has been cut down and burned, its ashes enriching the soil. Cultivation of the earth after clearing is usually accomplished by hoe or digging stick and not by plow.

Shifting agriculture has frequently been attacked in principle because it degrades the fertility of forestlands of tropical regions. Nevertheless, shifting agriculture is an adaptation to tropical soil conditions in regions where long-term, continued cultivation of the same field, without advanced techniques of soil conservation and the use of fertilizers, would be extremely detrimental to the fertility of the land. In such environments it may be preferable to cultivate a field for a short period and then abandon it before the soil is completely exhausted of nutrients. See also slash-and-burn agriculture."

A farmer’s ability to complete farming tasks on time and produce high-quality crops depends on their ability to choose the appropriate agricultural equipment. A wide range of farm equipment is available to modern farmers for various agricultural methods and activities. Agricultural equipment manufacturers, local or neighboring merchants, and even internet markets sell machinery. Let’s check out how to choose the right machinery for your farm below.

Before investing in any agricultural machinery, a farmer should be certain that the machinery is appropriate. If a farmer requires a harvest for a certain crop, he should choose a harvest based on the type of crop he intends to harvest. Using the correct equipment and cutting down on labour costs, a farmer can make his agricultural business profitable. 

Profits are increased, and crops are grown more quickly when farmers use the correct agricultural equipment. Soil and climatic conditions have a significant impact on the efficiency of any agricultural machinery. For this reason, farmers need to think about numerous factors before purchasing agricultural equipment to receive the expected results. 

In this article, we provided needed tips for choosing your farm machinery, factors affecting the selection of farm machinery, taking care of heavy machinery used in agriculture such as tractors, tractor and implement selection for different agricultural operations, operating principles of farm machinery, tips for selection of machinery, and selection of modern machines used in agriculture. 

Decide precisely what you need before you rush out and start spending money like there’s no tomorrow. Because of this, you will be better equipped to make wise decisions and will be less likely to waste your hard-earned money on items you may not even need.

Knowing your budget helps you decide what to buy. Before you react to a supplier’s offer or place an order, you should have a crystal clear image of your budget, both in general and for the specific purchase you want to make.

The vast majority of farm vehicles, tools, and other pieces of machinery are available for buy or lease. Larger pieces of agricultural equipment may often be rented on a short-term basis, unlike most smaller implements, which are typically not accessible for purchase via a leasing arrangement.

Leasing is a great option for anyone who would rather not make the investment required to purchase their heavy equipment. This is beneficial from a tax perspective since the renter does not have to pay any taxes on the equipment that is being leased.

A farmer with a larger land area would benefit from having more machines to complete the harvesting and planting activities. A farmer can also explore purchasing used machinery or buying an additional number of tractors or agricultural machines accessible on a pay-per-use basis. Another option is to rent these machines.

In case you missed it: Agriculture Machinery Subsidy, Tools, Equipment, Loan

Before buying agricultural equipment, a farmer must consider the soil. Depending on the kind of soil, the farmer must choose if a heavier or lighter machine would be more appropriate for their farming requirements. For a farm with light soil, for example, farm equipment with a greater ground clearance yet as light as possible would be appropriate. The way a plough operates can change depending on the texture and moisture level of the soil.

When determining the amount of the equipment you require, one of the most important factors to consider is the scale of your business. Many farmers choose to reduce their machinery by purchasing small farm machinery that does not need much storage space or fuel. You want to make sure that the size of the apparatus you use is appropriate for the task at hand, neither too big nor too tiny.

Equipment that is too tiny might need an increased number of passes or trips, which could drastically slow you down and lower the value of your machinery. Equipment that is too big, on the other hand, may have running expenses that are greater than what is required, and it may even be impossible to put the equipment in between rows of crops or in other confined spaces on your farm. In addition to physically fitting in the needed areas, it has to have sufficient power to do what you want it to do, such as lifting heavy loads.

Make sure the agricultural equipment manufacturer’s parts or repair centre is close. The contact information for the repairing facility or service centre should already be in a farmer’s hands. This will save them time and prevent interruptions to their most critical agricultural tasks.

When considering whether to purchase, evaluate all costs, including operating, owning, and paying employees. These costs should not be more than the value that can be reimbursed by selling the machinery. Even after many years of service, the equipment you purchase should be easy to resell under its original brand name. 

In case you missed it: Farm Machinery Types, Uses, and Importance

You should avoid purchasing machinery that is difficult to get rid of anytime you decide to do so since it is not in your best interest. As a result, it is strongly suggested that you get your machinery from a manufacturer with a leading position in the industry. This will guarantee that you get excellent service, but it will also increase the machinery’s resale value.

When the cost of brand-new machinery exceeds the budget, many farmers decide to purchase used farm machinery instead. This can be done via individual sales and dealer and plough supplier contacts. You can receive the equipment you want at a lower price than retail rates if you purchase it since most used equipment is still in excellent functioning condition.

You should make your equipment comfortable if you use it often. Although not everyone places as much importance on having a clean and comfortable cab, having one certainly makes one’s workday more pleasant. The level of comfort within the cab might even affect the security of the driver. Sturdy cages and safety measures provide several distinct benefits. 

Air conditioning units can help keep drivers comfortable despite the wildly fluctuating temperatures caused by the changing seasons. Because visibility is also a critical element of operating machines, the cab’s location can also be helpful in this regard.

Will you be able to use the attachments on your equipment to do several jobs, or is it designed just for one function? Think of all the tasks that need to be done on the farm, from the regular ones like feeding the animals and ploughing to the more project-based ones like planting, construction, and waste management. If you want to receive the attachments right soon, you should remember to include them in the cost of getting them. Investing in a coupler that enables you to swap between attachments is likely to be wise if you want to use a single piece of machinery for various jobs.

Do not hastily decide anything about a machine or equipment based only on its outward appearance. Consider purchasing a piece of farm equipment from a well-known and respected brand in the agricultural industry. You won’t have spare parts or maintenance issues. Find the most recent technological models with the greatest characteristics, evaluate them compared to other manufacturers, and choose any piece of machinery that meets your requirements.

In case you missed it: Sugarcane Farming in the USA: How to Start, Production States, Ideas, and Tips

Be sure to check the machine design. 

If you want to use the machine easily, you should check all technical data, beginning with its design and continuing through its adjustments, vibrations, areas of wear, and noise levels. To learn the specifics of the characteristics offered by the piece of equipment, you should seek the dealer’s assistance or a company representative.

Because farm machinery is a solid financial investment, you need to make your selection with additional caution so that you don’t make a mistake. You should give the piece of equipment a try first, and if you’re not satisfied with the results, you should take a second look at it.

Tractors are one of the most basic farm machinery in India. Here we have provided the list of factors to consider while buying a tractor. 

The size of your farm and the range of tasks that need to be completed are important considerations that should guide your selection of the horsepower rating of your tractor. There are now two different sorts of ratings that the manufacturers use to assess the tractor’s power. These ratings are engine horsepower and PTO horsepower.

Remember that the power of your tractor is entirely dependent on the engine that it contains. The tractor’s horsepower and the types of operations that it can successfully do are both dependent on the engine. When considering the purchase of a tractor, this is one reason why the engine should be a priority.

One of the choices to be taken is investing in a brand-new tractor or settling for an older model. Many people are concerned that old tractors are overpriced and have declining returns. Compared, purchasing a new tractor offers many advantages in size, safety, fuel consumption, configurations, and other factors.

In case you missed it: Government Subsidy for Agricultural Machines and Equipment: Get 50 to 80%

Be sure you understand how the tractor will be used before making your initial purchase. Different agricultural activities require the use of certain kinds of machinery. Make a list of the jobs that need to be done, and pick the tractor that best suits those needs rather than upgrading, which might be costly. On farms, different tractors with varying horse horsepower need to have tractor implements connected to them to complete the work that has to be done.

When buying a tractor, you need to be extremely attentive to the lift capacity since estimating it correctly can be challenging. Several distinct lift capabilities are available for tractors, including full height lift capacity, arm lift capacity, and static lift capacity. Other lift capacities are also available. 

In addition, the hydraulic flows and pressures that come standard with each tractor are distinct from one another. Because of this, it is vitally necessary, and it is recommended that you get a loader and tractor from the same manufacturer so that they will be compatible with one another.

A tractor you acquire should be simple to sell after many years. You wouldn’t want to get an unsellable tractor. As such, acquire your tractor from a top seller. This ensures excellent servicing and resale value.

To start a commercial poultry farm in Kenya some of the things you should consider is planning of the finances, objectives of your poultry farm, budget for your poultry farm, resources required to start your poultry farm and the profits you aim to generate on the long term. This is not rocket science as there are many established poultry farmers in Kenya making a ton of profits and decent income from their commercial poultry farms

Keep in mind that a small domestic poultry farm in Kenya requires smaller space, less capital compared to a larger commercial poultry farm.

POULTRY HOUSING

To start and manage your poultry well you need to have a correctly established poultry farm, a good housing for your poultry is very important as it will help you in;

In poultry housing in Kenya you should consider commercial goals for your poultry farm, rearing methods, the scale of your poultry farm and the conditions of the place of farming whether urban or rural area. There are several styles of creating simple or complex poultry farming houses all you need to do is search for ways you can create on your own or simply hire an expert to develop a good housing.

HOW MUCH SPACE DO YOU NEED FOR YOUR POULTRY

Regarding this question, common estimates vary but mostly common space you need for poultry is 2 to 3 feet inside per bird depending on the size of chicken for 100 chickens, inside housing should be at least 200 square feet and a 10 by 20 foot rectangle. Also consider an 8 feet high to give you comfortable space inside the poultry housing. To calculate the amount of chicken you are willing to keep just use the 100 chicken for 200 square feet rule and you are good to go.

perennial agriculture,  the cultivation of crop species that live longer than two years without the need for replanting each year. Perennial agriculture differs from mainstream agriculture in that it involves relatively less tilling and in some cases requires less labour and fewer pesticides, helping to maintain or even improve soil health. Perennial crops used in perennial agriculture are grown worldwide in various climates and are adapted to local environmental stressors.

The cultivation of perennial fruiting crop species is thought to have begun more than 11,000 years ago. In order to cultivate these species, human settlements had to remain stationary, a change that potentially affected the settlement patterns of some societies. Nonetheless, humans benefited from perennial fruit crops, which were less labour-intensive and had a relatively long lifespan—producing food for many years after a single planting—compared with food-producing plants that required annual planting. Over generations of artificial selection, the species were refined to produce increasingly palatable fruit. Later, the use of perennial species expanded to forage crops, such as alfalfa, and the production of timber crops to produce building materials.

In 1929, American geographer Joseph Russell Smith, concerned by the rapid destruction of the environment following the industrialization of crop farming, wrote Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture (1929), in which he described the potential for the sustainable cultivation of trees to combat erosion while also producing food in regions worldwide. The book inspired other researchers to explore the possibility of widespread perennial agriculture. Shortly thereafter, in the 1930s and ’40s, interest in sustainable perennial agriculture grew, in part due to the severe drought that ruined millions of acres of plowed cropland in the Dust Bowl of the Great Plains of the United States.

Also in the 1930s, Soviet researchers attempted to breed perennial wheat through hybridization techniques, though the idea was abandoned in the 1960s due to limited success. About the same time in the mid-20th century, researchers in California began investigating perennial wheat and were able to produce lines of prototype varieties that produced yields similar to those of existing low-yielding types. Yield increases in annual wheat, however, greatly diminished the economical viability of low-yielding perennial wheat varieties.

Compared with annual crops, perennial crops have extensive root systems, making soil particles difficult to dislodge and thereby limiting soil erosion. Erosion is further reduced by the limited amount of tilling needed to maintain the crop. In addition, since perennial crops do not need to be replanted every year, they require less labour than annuals, and perennials tend to grow rapidly in the spring, enabling them to outcompete annual weeds. They also have adapted over time to deal with local insects and diseases and therefore generally require fewer pesticide applications than annuals. Moreover, their large root systems enable them to cope with environmental stressors, such as drought or irregular rainfall, and they are able to sequester carbon more efficiently than annuals. Perennial grains also potentially could be bred to imitate some of the key aspects of threatened grasslands by providing habitat for wildlife and improving or maintaining soil health, while also producing food for human consumption.

Research into perennial grains slowed until the 2000s, when scientists, aided by a better understanding of plant genetics, began to reassess the plausibility and potential of perennial grains. With advancements in genetic technology, such as genetic mapping and genetic engineering, commercially viable perennial grains could be grown on a wide scale in the future. Researchers also found ways to expand the applications of perennial species. With genetic mapping, for example, researchers have been working to identify genes that can be controlled to increase biomass production in perennial species such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), an important source of biofuel.

The value of perennial grains, however, is challenged particularly by their limited yields, which is a result of the nature by which perennials continually regrow every year. Annual grains are able to divert much of their energy into the production of seeds, whereas perennials must divert energy to their root systems and seed development."

This is how to grow peas in Kenya guide with all information and answers to guide you on how to grow peas in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial pea’s farm or peas farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into peas farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW PEAS IN KENYA

PLANTING

Peas is a legume plant that can either be green and yellow In Kenya the main areas where peas is grown include, Nyandarua and Transnzoia. The varieties of peas grown in Kenya include;

The main variety of peas grown in Kenya is the snow peas and the ecological requirements for peas include: snow peas requires a fertile sandy- loamy soil that drain well, although peas tolerates most soil it is not tolerant to impermeable clay, peas thrive well in cool weather and altitude of between 1500-2600m above sea level, temperature of 12-20 degrees Celsius and well distributed rainfall of 1500mm to 2100mm

Planting of peas should be in a well ploughed and harrowed land free rom weeds, Peas are planted from their seeds and to improve germination, soak the seeds in water before planting on the field. Seeds are planted 1inch deep and spacing of 2 inches apart between seeds. Rows of planting peas should be 7 inches apart

Bush peas can reach 18 to 30 inches tall on height.  Pole types can grow to at least 4 to 6 feet tall. Both types benefit from support. You can construct support using chain link wires or support them on light poles for each plant.

For peas, fertilizers are not normally required but you can substitute fertilizers by using grass mulch.

Regular farm practices for peas farm continues

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your peas. Weeds harm the proper growth of the peas

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in peas making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

Watering of peas also can continue in areas with minimal or low rainfall

PEAS PESTS

The pests affecting peas include;

PEAS DISEASES

HARVESTING OF PEASPeas mature after 60 to 70 days of planting, peas are harvested when pods start to fatten, but before peas get too large. For best flavor consume peas directly during maturity period.

To harvest peas Use two hands when you pick peas to avoid damaging plant. Hold the vine with one hand and pull pods off with the other. Mature pea plants usually stop producing and die back in hot weather. Dry peas are harvested and can later be used as seeds

An acre piece of land can produce 400Kgs of fresh peas per week and harvesting can be done once per week for 13 weeks or more, this proofs how profitable peas farming in Kenya is. In Kenya 1 kg of peas can go up to 150 kshs, depending on time and availability.

MARKETTING OF PEAS IN KENYA

Large scale farmers of peas in Kenya can contact the exporters companies to help in sale, the main exporting companies in Kenya include; Homegrown Kenya Ltd, Idu Farm, Wamu Enterprises, Everest Enterprises and Kenya Horticultural Exporters Ltd (K.H.E)

Peas can also be sold locally on markets, supermarkets and institutions at a good price.

This is the passion fruit farming in Kenya the definitive guide to answer all your questions regarding passion fruit farming how to start, grow and scale your passion fruit farm. Before you venture into passion fruit farming there are some of the questions you have asked yourselves we intend to answer all these questions on this definitive guide

These are the steps you need to follow in order to successfully start your passion fruit farm and reap big harvest

Keep in mind that in Kenya passion fruit is the 3rd most popular fruit after mangoes and bananas respectively this should be enough motivation to get you started in passion fruit farming world, furthermore passion fruits are perennial crops so when you get started you will continue reaping big for some years depending on your input and maintenance

Estimated Costs and Returns for One Acre (approximation varies due to different factors)

Returns When well taken care of, each plant should yield a minimum of 1kg and up to 2kg of fruit per week. Therefore, taking the lowest in an ideal situation, each crop yields 1kg per week giving a total of 650kg per week from an acre. The lowest farm-gate price of passion fruits is Ksh.50 per kg hence a weekly income of 32,500. That translates to an annual income of 1.69 million shilling

LAND PREPARATION FOR PASSION FRUITS

We shall begin with the first step of preparing your land to be ready for planting passion fruits this is if we keep in mind that you already have passion fruit seedlings ready or if not we will have another article for you to guide you on how to prepare passion fruit seedlings

The land to be planted should be properly harrowed to fine texture and free from weeds. You may also choose to spray the area with a suitable insecticide to keep the area free from pests and diseases. Dig holes on the area with the measurements of 45 by 45centimetres and spacing between them to be 2 meters. Ensure that the holes are in even rows

PLANTING

After the first step your land is now ready for planting the passion fruits. If it’s a rainy season you are good to go but if not water the holes with sufficient water when your land has enough moisture proceed to plant all the seedlings on the land 1 seedling per hole. On this stage care for the seedlings continue for about 2 weeks until the seedlings have adapted to the new conditions. The care done in this period include

Water application: this should be done in right proportion once daily be it in evenings or morning but the best period is evenings. Avoid overwatering or under watering.

Soil conditioning: This is done by application of manure to the soil this is done in moderation too much nutrients or too little nutrients may damage your passion fruits

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your passion fruits. Weeds harm the proper growth of the passion fruits

Mulching: This is optional you can mulch your passion fruits to suppress weeds or conserve moisture on the soil

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in passion fruits making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

By following this practices within a matter of weeks your passion fruits should be growing vigorously and you will even notice tendrils

PASSION FRUITS SUPPORT

Passion fruits are climbers and when you notice tendrils on your passion fruits support is now needed. Supporting of passion fruits is done by using poles which are firm and strong this support is made by placing these poles on each passion plant. After placing the poles on each passion plant you need to find strong posts which you will place on each column both ends. These posts will be used to guide wires through each poles on the plants. After fully constructing support you can start guiding the passion plant by tying them on poles with a sisal or cloth to avoid your passion fruit seedling growing on the ground. This is done continuously until your passion fruit reach on wires. An alternative to this is by using chain links or wire mesh

HARVESTING

With proper management of passion fruits within ten months of planting or less you should have noticed the fruits turning purple or black for the purple passion type. Others you will have noticed they have dropped off the vines. Now it’s time to pick your passion fruits ripened ones and are ready for market it is important to immediately market them to prevent weight loss. Passion fruits are in high demand in some areas like Uasin-Gishu 1kg can go for up to 80kshs per KG.

STORAGE

Harvested passion fruits are picked and stored on sacks where they are tied up with sisal ready for transportation to various markets. Don’t miss on the opportunity to reap big from passion fruit farming by failing to follow these necessary steps

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

It is important to immediately market passion fruits to prevent weight loss. Passion fruit farming in Kenya is highly profitable in some areas like Uasin-Gishu 1kg can go for up to 80kshs per KG.

With proper management of passion fruits within ten months of planting or less you should have noticed the fruits turning purple or black for the purple passion type. Others you will have noticed they have dropped off the vines. Now it’s time to pick your passion fruits because they have matured.

Passion fruits have a wide range of health benefits some of these benefits include

There are five common varieties of passion fruits grown in Kenya and they are listed below they include

There are various fertilizers for passion fruit farmers to choose from ranging from top dressing with CAN to dressing with farmyard manure. For me as an experienced passion fruit farmer I will always go with organic farmyard manure.

What is grafted passion fruits: graftage is a horticultural technique whereby tissues of plants are joined so as to continue their growth together. This greatly enhances the quality of the passion fruit seedling. Do you want to learn how to graft and make money from your grafted seedlings? click here

When Solomon Shibelenje, a farmer in Uasin Gishu County, planted passion fruits in 2018 soon after retiring from National Bank of Kenya, he was doing it to break from the monotony of planting maize, the dominant crop in the region.

Today, Shibelenje who farms on five acres in Turbo, is a happy farmer. 

“When I harvested my first passion crop, the season was not good but I got some Sh500,000 from an acre. This was incomparable to the four acres of maize I was planting that gave me Sh100,000,” he said.

Shibelenje is among farmers in the Rift Valley and western Kenya who are reaping from the crop having found ready market from exporting firms.

“I grow and sell my fruits to Equatorial Hortifresh Company. Market is, therefore, not a problem,” says Shibelenje.

The farmer notes that once one plants the seedlings, they must ensure the farm is free of weeds and the crops are adequately watered.

“After eight months you start harvesting your fruits and this will go on for 18 months.”

Moses Keitany, the chief executive of Equatorial Hortifresh Company, says farmers in western are taking up passion fruit farming due to high returns. 

""Passion fruit cultivation has received a major boost because of its enhanced returns compared to other crops like maize and sugarcane,"" says Keitany. 

From an acre of the fruits, he says one can reap up to Sh620,000 per season.  However, despite farmers taking up the crop, he says production of the fruit remains low.

“We get orders from Belgium, Uganda and the UK but sometimes we are forced to cancel because our current production can neither satisfy local nor global markets,” Keitany points out.

According to him, Belgium requires a tonne of the fruits from Kenya each week while Kampala a similar quantity.  The firm buys a kilo of the fruits from farmers at an average of Sh80. Further, they sell the grafted purple and yellow varieties seedlings to farmers at Sh50. 

Similarly, trellising wires go at Sh4,500 per roll. The inputs are given to farmers on credit and the money recovered when the produce is harvested.

Alice Nalianya, a farmer in Lugari constituency, grows the fruits on an acre. They are planted in several rows supported with trellised wires and poles to keep fruits off the ground. 

Alice Nalianya and other farmers get tips on planting passion fruit from agricultural officers.

“The firm offers seedlings, trellising wires and extension services. I am looking forward to becoming a successful passion fruit farmer in Kakamega,” says Nalianya.

Antony Kirwa, an agronomist in Lugari sub-county, says the crop is now farmed in Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma, Trans Nzoia and Uasin Gishu counties.

“Over 150 farmers are growing the crop on 53 hectares, ranging from quarter to three acres.”

Some of the challenges farmers have to contend with are diseases like woodiness virus, brown leaf spot and wilt and as well as lack of water, especially during dry spells.

To realise optimum benefits, farmers have been asked to join cooperative societies where they can be trained and supported by both public and private players on taking care of their plants.

Hilary Onjoro, Kakamega County chief officer for agriculture, says the county is suitable for passion fruit production. According to him, the plant grows best in compost-rich and well-drained soils with a pH of between 6.5 and 7.5.

“Passion fruit is a natural climber that grows rapidly. The two types are differentiated by the colour of their fruits,” says Onjoro.

He notes purple passion plants are self-pollinating while the yellow variety depends on insects to transfer pollen from one plant to the next for pollination.

origins of agriculture,  the active production of useful plants or animals in ecosystems that have been created by people. Agriculture has often been conceptualized narrowly, in terms of specific combinations of activities and organisms—wet-rice production in Asia, wheat farming in Europe, cattle ranching in the Americas, and the like—but a more holistic perspective holds that humans are environmental engineers who disrupt terrestrial habitats in specific ways. Anthropogenic disruptions such as clearing vegetation or tilling the soil cause a variety of localized changes; common effects include an increase in the amount of light reaching ground level and a reduction in the competition among organisms. As a result, an area may produce more of the plants or animals that people desire for food, technology, medicine, and other uses.

Over time, some plants and animals have become domesticated, or dependent on these and other human interventions for their long-term propagation or survival. Domestication is a biological process in which, under human selection, organisms develop characteristics that increase their utility, as when plants provide larger seeds, fruit, or tubers than their wild progenitors. Known as cultigens, domesticated plants come from a wide range of families (groups of closely related genera that share a common ancestor; see genus). The grass (Poaceae), bean (Fabaceae), and nightshade or potato (Solanaceae) families have produced a disproportionately large number of cultigens because they have characteristics that are particularly amenable to domestication.

Domesticated animals tend to have developed from species that are social in the wild and that, like plants, could be bred to increase the traits that are advantageous for people. Most domesticated animals are more docile than their wild counterparts, and they often produce more meat, wool, or milk as well. They have been used for traction, transport, pest control, assistance, and companionship and as a form of wealth. Species with abundant domesticated varieties, or breeds, include the dog (Canis lupus familiaris), cat (Felis catus), cattle (Bos species), sheep (Ovis species), goat (Capra species), swine (Sus species), horse (Equus caballus), chicken (Gallus gallus), and duck and goose (family Anatidae).

Because it is a cultural phenomenon, agriculture has varied considerably across time and space. Domesticated plants and animals have been (and continue to be) raised at scales ranging from the household to massive commercial operations. This article recognizes the wide range of activities that encompass food production and emphasizes the cultural factors leading to the creation of domesticated organisms. It discusses some of the research techniques used to discern the origins of agriculture as well as the general trajectory of agricultural development in the ancient societies of Southwest Asia, the Americas, East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Europe. For specific techniques of habitat alteration and plant propagation, see horticulture. For techniques of animal propagation, see livestock farming; poultry farming."

organic farming,  agricultural system that uses ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilizers derived largely from animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological benefits.

Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields. Indeed, yields of organic crops have been found to be about 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown crops, although this can vary considerably depending upon the type of crop. The challenge for future organic agriculture will be to maintain its environmental benefits, increase yields, and reduce prices while meeting the challenges of climate change and an increasing world population.

The concepts of organic agriculture were developed in the early 1900s by Sir Albert Howard, F.H. King, Rudolf Steiner, and others who believed that the use of animal manures (often made into compost), cover crops, crop rotation, and biologically based pest controls resulted in a better farming system. Howard, having worked in India as an agricultural researcher, gained much inspiration from the traditional and sustainable farming practices he encountered there and advocated for their adoption in the West. Such practices were further promoted by various advocates—such as J.I. Rodale and his son Robert, in the 1940s and onward, who published Organic Gardening and Farming magazine and a number of texts on organic farming. The demand for organic food was stimulated in the 1960s by the publication of Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, which documented the extent of environmental damage caused by insecticides.

Organic food sales increased steadily from the late 20th century. Greater environmental awareness, coupled with concerns over the health impacts of pesticide residues and consumption of genetically modified (GMO) crops, fostered the growth of the organic sector. In the United States retail sales increased from $20.39 billion in 2008 to $47.9 billion in 2019, while sales in Europe reached more than $52 billion (€45 billion) in 2019.

The price of organic food is generally higher than that of conventionally grown food. Depending on the product, the season, and the vagaries of supply and demand, the price of organic food can be anywhere from less than 10 percent below to more than 100 percent above that of conventionally grown produce.

Organic agriculture is defined formally by governments. Farmers must be certified for their produce and products to be labeled “organic,” and there are specific organic standards for crops, animals, and wild-crafted products and for the processing of agricultural products. Organic standards in the European Union (EU) and the United States, for example, prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, ionizing radiation, sewage sludge, and genetically engineered plants or products. In the EU, organic certification and inspection is carried out by approved organic control bodies according to EU standards. Organic farming has been defined by the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) since 2000, and there are many accredited organic certifiers across the country.

Although most countries have their own programs for organic certification, certifiers in the EU or the United States can inspect and certify growers and processors for other countries. This is especially useful when products grown organically in Mexico, for example, are exported to the United States.

Since synthetic fertilizers are not used, building and maintaining a rich, living soil through the addition of organic matter is a priority for organic farmers. Organic matter can be applied through the application of manure, compost, and animal by-products, such as feather meal or blood meal. Due to the potential for harbouring human pathogens, the USDA National Organic Standards mandate that raw manure must be applied no later than 90 or 120 days before harvest, depending on whether the harvested part of the crop is in contact with the ground. Composted manure that has been turned 5 times in 15 days and reached temperatures between 55 and 77.2 °C (131 and 171 °F) has no restrictions on application times. Compost adds organic matter, providing a wide range of nutrients for plants, and adds beneficial microbes to the soil. Given that these nutrients are mostly in an unmineralized form that cannot be taken up by plants, soil microbes are needed to break down organic matter and transform nutrients into a bioavailable “mineralized” state. In comparison, synthetic fertilizers are already in mineralized form and can be taken up by plants directly.

Soil is maintained by planting and then tilling in cover crops, which help protect the soil from erosion off-season and provide additional organic matter. The tilling in of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, such as clover or alfalfa, also adds nitrogen to the soil. Cover crops are commonly planted before or after the cash crop season or in conjunction with crop rotation and can also be planted between the rows of some crops, such as tree fruits. Researchers and growers are working to develop organic farming “no-till” and reduced-tillage practices in order to further reduce erosion.

Organic pesticides are derived from naturally occurring sources. These include living organisms such as the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, which is used to control caterpillar pests, or plant derivatives such as pyrethrins (from the dried flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) or neem oil (from the seeds of Azadirachta indica). Mineral-based inorganic pesticides such as sulfur and copper are also allowed.

In addition to pesticides, organic pest control integrates biological, cultural, and genetic controls to minimize pest damage. Biological control utilizes the natural enemies of pests, such as predatory insects (e.g., ladybugs) or parasitoids (e.g., certain wasps) to attack insect pests. Pest cycles can be disrupted with cultural controls, of which crop rotation is the most widely used. Finally, traditional plant breeding has produced numerous crop varieties that are resistant to specific pests. The use of such varieties and the planting of genetically diverse crops provide genetic control against pests and many plant diseases."

This is the profitable onion farming in Kenya definitive guide with all information and answers to guide you on profitable onion farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial onion farming or onion farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into onion farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW ONIONS IN KENYA

PLANTING

Onion is a tuber crop grown in Kenya mainly for commercial and domestic consuming, it is the most used spice to prepare almost every meal. The main variety of onions grown in Kenya is the red creole onion and we shall skip directly to its ecological requirements. Onions requires well drained soil with a PH of 6 to 6.8 this is always to ensure macronutrient uptake, altitude of 1900m above sea level, temperature of about 15 to 30 degrees Celsius, higher temperatures result to production of small onion bulbs and well distributed rainfall throughout the growth period 500-700mm, during maturity minimal rainfall is required.

The land to be planted to should be ploughed and harrowed so as to bring the soil to fine tilt and to avoid hardpans which may hinder the growth of onions and the tuber development, remember that onions can be grown from transplants or prepared directly from the seeds on nursery beds

NURSERY PREPARATION

To make a nursery bed for onions make sure you raise soils mixed with manure to 1metre width and to the length of your liking depending on amount of seedlings. Rows on the seed bed should be 15cm apart and seeds planted and covered with thin soil preferably 1 cm. Mulch the nursery after sowing seeds and then after 7 to 10 days remove the mulch after germination

The seed rate for onion farming in Kenya ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 kg per acre

Irrigation, thinning and weeding of the nursery continues up to 6 to 8 weeks where the seedlings can be transplanted to the farm properly harrowed free from weeds. On the land to be transplanted ensure to make trenches in rows to depth of 3cm deep and spacing between rows to be 30cm and spacing from each plant be 8 to 10cm. Fertilizer application for onions is normally decomposed farmyard manure of 10-16tonnes per acre well mixed with soil in the area where seedlings are to be planted. Seedlings are normally transplanted in the evening and when the soil is wet to ease when covering up the seedlings on trenches. Top dressing of onions can be done with CAN this is after 30 days of transplanting before onions start producing bulbs. 40kg of CAN per acre. Onions can always be intercropped with vegetables

Regular farm practices for onion farm continues

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your onions. Weeds harm the proper growth of the onions

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in onions making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

Watering of onions also can continue until bulging stage where you reduce amount of water

ONIONS DISEASES

ONION PESTS

By following the farm practices within a matter of weeks your onions should be growing vigorously and rapidly.

HARVESTING OF ONIONSOnions in Kenya is usually ready for harvesting after 120 to 150 days after transplanting when 75% of your onion tops have dried and fallen now it’s ready for harvesting. Harvesting of onions is done by pulling then left on the soil for curing. Necks of onions should be allowed to dry completely this can take up to 3 weeks of curing this greatly improves shelf life for onions.

Before storage of onions sorting is important to determine the grade of onions sorting can be based on size, injuries, decay and bolted onions. Onions can then be packaged on nets or crates.

MARKETTING

After successfully harvesting your onions you are now ready for marketing after storage in crates or nets. Onions are sold in kilograms to various market around Kenya

A 60-kilometre drive along the Kibwezi-Kitui Road leads one to Mutha, a sleepy trading centre near the boundary of Kitui and Tana River counties.

Inside the township there is a market called Kyuuni, which becomes lively for only six hours on Wednesdays and at the centre of trading activities are Galla goats.

The market has revolutionised livestock farming in the sparsely populated region where the sun is hot as coal fire.

While the goat sellers mainly come from the two counties, buyers troop from Nairobi and Mombasa in search of the popular goat breed. 

""We link farmers and the large-scale buyers who travel from different parts of the country for Galla goats. Most of the times, the buyers send us money in advance so that we buy them the goats ahead of the market day,"" Mary Katiki, a broker tells the Seeds of Gold team after successfully bargaining and buying two he-goats from Abdulla Golicha, a livestock farmer from Tana River.

Every Wednesday, the mother of six normally heads to the market at dawn armed with nothing but a sweet tongue and determination.

With a 13-year experience, Mary knows how to talk well to farmers and livestock traders. On this day, she has a target of 60 he-goats to source for a regular client based in Nairobi. Each of the animals goes from Sh3,000 to Sh8,000. From each she earns a commission of between Sh500 and Sh1,000.

Mutha is the biggest Galla goats market in the arid region ravaged by drought. According to Nzenge Longosi, the chairman of Mutha Livestock Traders, most of the hundreds of goats and sheep traded weekly at the market come from Tana River, Mandera and Garissa counties. 

Traders prefer young Galla goats because they produce high quality meat. Before buying, they look at the general health of the animal, in particular its dental formula. 

Goats with dental deformities have problems feeding leading to poor health.

Residents whose homesteads border the livestock market make money by keeping unsold stock.

""We charge Sh20 per night for a goat. Sometimes we keep up to 100 goats. Some of the traders keep their goats with us for a week until the next market day. It is a risky business as it is prone to theft and attack by wild animals. We take responsibility in case the animals go missing. To minimise confusion, owners of the goats mark their animals with paint,” says Avia Kyalo, a resident. 

As demand for Galla goats grows, most farmers have replaced the East African Small Goat with the former, a superior breed widely regarded as the king of meat and milk.

""Galla goats can last days without drinking water. Most farmers buy goats after selling green grams in April. However, August and September are the most appropriate times to buy goats. Drought ravaging the region around this time forces the pastoralist community to dispose of their livestock cheaply to cut on losses. We keep the animals until they gain sufficient weight and the market is favourable,” says Stephen Ngovu, a local teacher who is in the business of fattening goats for the market.

Temi Mutia, the executive in-charge of value addition at the Kitui county government, says the goats’ industry in the arid county is worth millions of shillings. 

In 2019, the county government organised farmers in Mutha into a cooperative society after securing a lucrative market for goat meat in the Middle East. The market was, however, interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Temi says, but they hope trading would soon start.

When a farmer sells a goat at the market or any other in Kitui County, they are required to pay Sh40 cess to the county government for every animal. 

Traders who buy the animals also pay Sh40 for each and must be licensed by the county government to ascertain that the animals are acquired rightfully. To transport the animals through counties traders are required to posses a livestock transport licence.

no-till agriculture, also called till-less agriculture,  cultivation technique in which the soil is disturbed only along the slit or in the hole into which the seeds are planted; reserved detritus from previous crops covers and protects the seedbed. The practice is one of several so-called “primitive farming” methods that have been revived as conservation measures in the 20th century.

Unlike conventional tillage, which controls weed growth by plowing and cultivating, conventional no-till agriculture often uses large quantities of selective herbicides to kill weeds and the remains of the previous crop. Seeds are then sown into this “sod.” In organic farming, seeds are frequently planted through the residues of the previous crop without the use of herbicides, and farmers often rotate the crops in a field, with soybeans following a wheat crop, for example. Organic no-till practices also commonly involve the interplanting of cover crops to help suppress weeds.

Whether conventional or organic, a primary benefit of the protection and minimal disturbance of topsoil is a decreased rate of soil erosion. The vegetation detritus of no-till techniques protects seedlings when they are most vulnerable to the ravages of nature and can act as a mulch for the growing plants, helping to retain soil moisture, providing additional nutrition as the residues decompose, and suppressing weeds. The no-till technique reduces equipment, fuel, and fertilizer needs and, significantly, the time required for tending crops. The method improves soil-aggregate formation, microbial and invertebrate activity in the soil, and water infiltration and storage, while enabling cultivation on slopes of up to 15 percent. In addition, no-till agriculture has gained attention as a form of carbon sequestration in the fight against global warming. Undisturbed soil serves as a carbon sink and can thus help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Crops suited to the technique include corn (maize), small grains, pigeon pea, cowpea, and soybean.

Given that the plant residues can also lower the soil surface temperature, the practicality of using the no-till system is limited in some areas to warmer regions or to plant varieties suited to cooler seedling-growing conditions. Some resistance to till-less agriculture and its variations has come from machinery manufacturers and from farmers themselves, to many of whom the debris-laden fields required by the procedure connote inferior farming. However, a long-term study published in 2020 indicated that no-till agriculture has very positive economic and environmental benefits over decades compared to conventional till practices."

Millet is a general term for classifying small-seeded grasses, often called food grains or dryland cereals, and includes Sorghum, Pearl Millet, Ragi, Chickpea Millet, Foxtail Millet, Proso Millet, Barnard Millet, Kodo Millet, and other Millets are included. Millet is a hardy crop with small seeds that can thrive in arid or rainfed areas under modest soil fertility and moisture conditions. Let’s check out the top 12 steps to boost Millet yield.

Millet is called ‘miracle grain’ or ‘crop of the future because it can grow in harsh conditions and is also a drought-tolerant crop that requires fewer external inputs. Minor Millets such as Kodo, Kutki, and Sama rice were grown by many farmers in the plains of Central India. Recently, due to an entire market focused on wheat and rice, some efforts have been made to promote Millet. 

As a result, an increase in Millet cultivation will encourage the average farmer while achieving the goals of increasing income and crop diversification. Follow these below simple steps to get more yield in Millet cultivation.

Different types of Millet require different climatic conditions; however, the pattern of climatic conditions remains the same for almost all:

Millet is cultivated in less fertile lands, tribal and rainfed areas, and mountainous areas. Millets can grow not only in bad climates or soil conditions and provide nutritious grains and fodder but also because of their small growing season under irrigation and dryland cultivation. Millet is a dual-purpose crop. It is cultivated as both food and fodder, thus providing food security to millions of households and then contributing to the economic efficiency of farming.

Millet is considered a smart climate crop adapted by Indian farmers. Its yield success rate is much higher than other crops as it is a very low maintenance crop. It requires very little irrigation, and the fertilizer is not disease-resistant and in good demand in the market. Millet cultivation deserves encouragement, especially in its climatic flexibility, short crop duration, ability to grow with poor soils, mountainous areas, and low rainfall. 

Because of their access to the poor, they can play an important role in providing nutrition to people of all income groups and adapting the climate to rain-fed farming systems. Millet is being promoted through the spread of technology, quality seeds through the Millet seed center, awareness-raising, and minimum support price. Promoting Millet can help governments save on health and nutrition costs. 

Dedicated programs with appropriate training and capacity-building initiatives that encourage farmers to diversify their crops through Millet can be a timely way to pull farmers away from the region’s distress. 

At the onset of the monsoon, the first plow should be plowed with a deep plow. Fine tillage is essential for proper germination and crop formation.

Barnyard Millet – It grows up to 2100 meters in height in subtropical and sub-tropical regions. 60-80 cm of rain is required annually. Temperature requirements are between 18-27°C. It grows well in sandy loam to clayey soils with high organic matter content and a pH between 5.5 and 7.5.

Finger Millet – It grows at high altitudes with extreme weather conditions. Grain ripening requires a dry spell and annual rainfall is about 70-120 cm. Temperature requirements are about 25-30°C. It grows well in red, black, sandy, loamy, and lateral soils with a pH of about 4.5-8. 

Foxtail Millet – It grows in hot, barren, semi-arid, and tropical regions and can survive in poor water resources. Annual rainfall of 50-75 cm is required. Temperature requirements range from 15-30°C. Grows well in sandy loam with a pH of 5.5-7.

Proso Millet – Proso Millet is grown in India during Kharif and summer. It can also tolerate stagnant water to some extent. It is a hard crop that completes its life cycle in a short time. It can be grown in rich and poor soils, with variable textures, ranging from sandy loam to black cotton soils. Proso Millet can be sown in 3-4 cm deep skins by seed drill by broadcasting or line sowing. 

Pearl Millet – It can be grown in different soils. Three sowing systems are practiced in pearl Millet: on a flat surface, using a ridge and furrow system, or a broad bed and furrow system. Seeds should be sown at 2.5 cm to 3 cm depth.

Improved breeds of Millet – Improved quantities of Millet can significantly increase Millet’s yield and field yield with disease resistance. For example, ‘Okashana 1’, a variety produced from the double production of naturally grown Millet in India. ‘Okashana 1’ has become the most popular variety and is an important food for consumers. 

Despite its many qualities, the use of Millet as food is limited to traditional consumers, the tribal population. Recently, Millet has gained attention, and efforts are on to get its easy and value-added processed products. Since many households in arid lands and mountainous areas rely on Millet to meet their food needs, it is time to enlarge the food basket and add Jowar, Bajra, Ragi, etc., to the public distribution system. 

The government has recognized the role of Millet in the food chain. Under the NFSM, the share of Millet under the initial targets of an additional 25 million tonnes of food grain production under the National Food Security Mission is 2 million tonnes or 8% of improved food production. Indian policymakers turned their attention to the Millet farming system and formulated policies to create a conducive farming environment. Regarding Millet production, some of the existing schemes of the Government of India include;

Millet is grown in less fertile soil, so fertilizing is optional. Focusing on high nitrogen products, such as feeder food, is your best option if you want to fertilize Millet. This plant can be susceptible to fertilizer burns, so do not apply it directly to the seed. Apply fertilizer at the planting time and again after four weeks. Millet is usually grown on less fertile lands. 

Generally, 40-100 lb nitrogen and 30-60 lb phosphorus per acre are sufficient to produce grass or seeds, but for grazing, most fodder crops need more fertilizer to increase fodder production capacity and volume. The amount of fodder required and the number of livestock pastured will determine factors in planning nitrogen fertilization methods. Nitrogen requirements for heavy fodder production and heavy grazing may double those required for hay or seed crops. 

Phosphorus requirements will also be higher than hay or seed crops. Soil tests are recommended to assess the need for nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers and identify deficiencies in any other essential nutrients that may limit productivity. These nutrients mainly include magnesium, iron, copper, boron, manganese, zinc, potassium, sulfur, calcium, molybdenum, and chlorine. 

Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient in Millet farming. Nitrogen rates should be based on production targets and crop history. Excess nitrogen, whether applied or residual, can cause formation. Allow nitrogen to be used as fertilizer or other waste. Phosphorus and potassium should be applied as required based on soil recommendations. Fertilizer drill row application (except for direct phosphorus fertilizers) can cause seed injury and is not recommended. Millet is recommended for pH 5.6 or higher.

In case you missed it: Barnyard Millet Farming – Production Practices

Millet requires very little effort. There are only two things to cultivate: go to the field and broadcast the seeds, then come back three months later to harvest the grain. Millet is a low-maintenance crop that requires very little input. Farmers cultivate Millets mostly in the Kharif season. If there is good rain at regular intervals, farmers can expect a significant harvest. Average rainfall of 350-550 mm will suffice for Millet cultivation. 

Millets are less susceptible to pests and diseases and can be used in intercrop or mixed crop cultivation without any pesticides. Millets are usually grown with legumes to obtain the desired results. Since standard Millet seeds are very small, care should be taken not to sow the seeds to a depth of more than 2 inches. 

Sowing in a uniform line will be preferred over broadcasting so that the plant has access to all applicable inputs. Encouraging Millet cultivation is important because of its tolerance to climate, low crop length, and poor soils, its ability to thrive in mountainous areas, and with very little rainfall can play an important role in providing nutrition and helping to adapt the climate to rain-fed farming systems.

Millets are highly resistant to insect attacks. It is a feature that mainly comes in handy when planning mixed crop farms using non-pesticide management methods. Separation of rows of more sensitive legumes is common on farms in different parts of the world. 

In case you missed it: Proso Millet Farming, Cultivation Practices

Wheat Curl Mite — Foxtail Millet is known to harbor this insect that can transmit wheat streak mosaic to winter wheat. By early August, cutting the foxtail for hay and then pruning should kill the crop and prevent it from acting as a host. 

Grasshoppers – These insects have been the most serious on the Millets. Insecticides used on Millet are used to control grasshoppers. 

Armyworms – These worms may be common but can be controlled with pesticides. Also, some insects are minor bugs. When growing Millet, grasshoppers, army worms, chinch bugs, and false chinch bugs are all things to keep in mind. Spinosad and neem oil are very effective for fall armyworms. Armyworms can also be treated with BT spray, a liquid form of Bacillus thuringiensis. Chinch bugs can be treated with a spray of pyrethrin or Beauvaria bassiana, a natural fungus that cleans them.

When Millet is to be harvested depends on why it is being grown. To get the most nutritious grass, Millet should be harvested at the boot stage, meaning the head has grown and grown in size but is still closed in its sheath. At this point, they are prevented from achieving maximum yield and quality hay production. Plant growth slows down, and purple or brown seeds form heads. 

In northern conditions, the crop is ready for harvest by October or about 70-90 days after sowing, when the upper half of the seed heads, or the panicles, turn brown. At this point, the lower seeds may still be in the soft flour stage but should no longer be green in color. Millet is sometimes threshed when the seed heads are about 2/3 brown and allowed to dry further in the field before combining. 

This practice allows the straw to dry out and makes harvesting easier. It is also possible to cut the Millet crop on a combine with a common grain header. For grain, Proso Millet should yield about 50 bushels per acre or more, depending on the conditions. In the Northeast, the demand for Millet as a grain for bread and flour is increasing. 

However, after harvesting and weeding the grain, it must be removed for human consumption. Millet seed hulls vary in color and can be stripped. Millet should be cleaned with weed seeds and broken kernels; it should not be stored at more than 13% moisture.

This is How to grow managu African nightshade full guide to enable you start and grow your managu farm. Whether for commercial or domestic purpose, we intend to answer all the questions regarding managu farming in Kenya in this guide. Narrow-leaved African nightshades, also called managu in Swahili, is widely distributed throughout the tropics and can be found throughout East Africa. Before venturing into managu farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you usually ask yourself some of these questions regarding managu farming include:

HOW TO PLANT AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE

PLANTING

The seed rate for the African nightshade (Managu) is 50g per acre. ensure you purchase only certified seeds planting can be done by preparing a nursery bed first or simply planting directly on a well prepared field. Nursery preparation: Loosen the nursery soil and apply well-decomposed manure or DAP, making sure that the manure is well incorporated into the soil. Make drills that are 10 to 20 centimeters apart, where you will then sow the seeds and cover them lightly with soil. You may also choose to raise the nursery bed to aid in loosening the soil. The size of the nursery bed will depend on the amount of African nightshade you want to plant.

Regulars farm practices of the nursery bed which include watering once daily especially at the evenings, weeding and thinning continues. The African Nightshade seedlings will be ready for transplanting 30 days after seeding or when they have 5 to 6 true leaves and a height of between 10 to 15 centimeters.

The land where the vegetable is to be transplanted should be ready , fertile and free from weeds if the area is not that fertile, Phosphorus fertilizer should be applied in the form of DSP at the rate of 75 kgs per acre. In the field to be transplanted, Plant the seeds in the already prepared rows of 30 cm apart, with the spacing between the plants being 15cm. ensure you uproot the seedlings from the nursery after application of water to ensure softening of the soil and to avoid loosing roots in the hard soil.

After transplanting, your African night shade seedlings on the farm regular farming practices continues for a period of about two weeks when the vegetables have adapted. These farm practices include;

Mulching: This is done by adding materials such as grass waste beneath the soil to ensure the African nightshade plant conserve moisture and also the weeds are suppressed.

Irrigation: this is done by application of water to the plants mainly in the evening to ensure frequent and adequate moisture supply to the managu vegetable although this vegetable is drought resistant its important to grow with enough moisture to increase productivity

Weeding: this is done by uprooting unwanted plants that grows with the African nightshade to ensure that pest and diseases are prevented and also competition for nutrients with plants are reduced and discouraged.

collards, cabbages, broccoli are the best intercropping partners for African Nightshade. Research in Egerton University, Kenya has shown that intercropping crops from the nightshade family increase the leaf yield of kales (Sukuma Wiki). 

PESTS AND DISEASES AFFECTING AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE

APHIDS

Aphids are a major pest, causing leaves to curl and become unattractive to customers. Aphids feed by sucking plant sap. Small aphid populations may be relatively harmless, but heavily infested plants usually have wrinkled leaves, stunted growth and deformed pods. Plants, in particular young plants, may dry out and die under heavy aphid attack. Heavy attack on older plants may cause crop loss by decreasing flower and seed production. Damage may also reduce seed viability.

SPIDER MITES

The plant’s leaves and growth tips are susceptible to mites (very small, sucking arthropods) that result in twisted growth and low productivity. Generally, spider mites feeding may cause reduction in plant growth, flowering, number and length of berries, and number of seeds per berry. Damage is most severe when mites attack young plants. Mite damage may be particularly severe during the dry season.

EARLY BLIGHT

Leaf spots of early blight are circular, up to 1 cm in brown, and often show a circular pattern which distinguishes this disease from other leaf spots. Early blight thrives best under warm wet conditions. Leaf spots first appear on the oldest leaves and progress upward on the plant. Entire plant could be defoliated and killed. Controlling early blight once it has established is very difficult. The most important way of controlling early blight is attempting to prevent its establishment and further spread.

Both organic and inorganic pesticides can be used to control pests and diseases on your managu vegetables, seek advice from an agriculture extension worker on pest and disease identification and management.

HARVESTING OF AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE

African nightshade is ready for harvesting starting from 4 weeks after transplanting.  The stems are cut approximately 15 cm above the ground. This allows new side shoots to develop. Picking is done at weekly intervals. Picking should be done very early in the morning and the produce sold the same day. Alternatively, the managu crop can be harvested late in the afternoon and placed on banana leaves. These should be tied in small bundles. The flowers should be removed before the crop is taken to market. Water these bundles sparingly to retain freshness of the crop. This method of harvesting is the most preferred as it gives the farmer continual produce for 3 to 4 months. Remove the flowers regularly to ensure the managu plant continues to produce more leaves, instead of focusing its resources on developing the fruits.

MARKET FOR AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE

High demand for African Nightshade vegetable has provided ready market for this kind of vegetable. It is important to note that this crop is highly perishable vegetable harvesting should be done with ready market or likewise, refrigeration can be done by placing stems on cold water to keep them fresh. Managu can be sold in;

The yield per acre for  AFRICAN NIGHTSHADE is between 4 tonnes and 8 tonnes per acre, depending on the management and variety of Managu planted.

This is the definitive guide on how to grow maize in Kenya with all the details and all your questions answered on maize farming. Some of the main questions we intend to answer on this guide regarding maize farming in Kenya include;

HOW TO GROW MAIZE IN KENYA

PLANTING

Maize is a cereal and is the staple food to Kenyans who likes consuming ugali, a food made using ground maize or maize flour. Maize also has a lot of various uses such as making of cooking oil, preparing silage and maize flour and can also be used in making of porridge.

Before growing of maize you should consider the following ecological conditions; evenly distributed rainfall especially during the planting and flowering phase, temperature needed will determine the rate of maturity higher temperatures favors the faster maturity of maize plantation, maize plantation also tolerates a wide variety of soil but a well-drained and fertile soil is preferred for maximum production. The choice of seed for production of maize varies with the altitude and rainfall conditions.

Land preparation is done by ploughing the land and after that harrowing is done to turn the soil into fine tilt. Planting of maize is now done 2 weeks after the onset of rain but in lowlands planting of maize is done before the onset of rain.

Planting is done mechanically using a planter especially in large areas of land. The planter will automatically plant with specified amount of seeds and fertilizers which is mostly DAP fertilizer.

When planting manually, use 50kg of DAP fertilizer per acre with seed rate of 1 to 2 seeds per hole, keep in mind that holes should be dug uniformly on straight lines. DAP fertilizer aid sin root development. After 3 to four weeks after planting when the maize crops are 1.5 feet high topdressing is done with CAN. CAN is placed on the roots of each plant in a minimum handful amount. In areas of high rainfall top dressing can be done twice CAN is used in the rate of 50kg per acre. UREA nitrogenous fertilizer can also be used

WEEDING

Weeds can grow with maize plantation hence competing for nutrients. Weeding can be done manually or using herbicides which will suppress the growth of weeds and allow maize plantation to grow. Weeds should be controlled on early stage of maize growth.

Various pests and diseases might also affect the maize plantation this can be controlled by use of pesticides and insecticides. The main pests and diseases that always affect maize include;

PESTS

Diseases

Harvesting of maize

Maize harvesting period varies according to variety of maize with the short period variety being harvested after the maturity period of 3 to 4 months while other varieties maturing at 10 months. Maize can be harvested while still green or dried. Proper drying and storage of matured maize cereals is advisable. Before storage, maize cereals should be treated to prevent storage pests and increase shelf life.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON HOW TO GROW MAIZE

In Kenya with proper farm management, an acre of maize plantation can produce 30 bags of maize with 90kgs of each and every bag.

In Kenya with proper farm management an acre of maize plantation can produce 30 bags of maize with 90kgs of each and every bag. Price for 90kg of maize varies according to availability and period of marketing mostly 90kg of maize goes for 2500 to 3300kshs but at times it can drop to 2300kshs per 90kg.

To determine the cost of planting an acre of maize in Kenya calculate the amount of seeds needed per acre, amount of fertilizers to be used,  periodical maintenance like topdressing, weeding, pest and diseases control, harvesting, labor and transport. This is the blueprint for calculating the cost.

There are various market for maize farmers to choose from. Maize can be sold to cereals board, open air market, milling factories and institutions like schools offers ready market

farm machinery,  mechanical devices, including tractors and implements, used in farming to save labour. Farm machines include a great variety of devices with a wide range of complexity: from simple hand-held implements used since prehistoric times to the complex harvesters of modern mechanized agriculture.

The operations of farming for which machines are used are diverse. For crop production they include handling of residues from previous crops; primary and secondary tillage of the soil; fertilizer distribution and application; seeding, planting, and transplanting; cultivation; pest control; harvesting; transportation; storage; premarketing processing; drainage; irrigation and erosion control; and water conservation. Livestock production, which not so long ago depended primarily on the pitchfork and scoop shovel, now uses many complicated and highly sophisticated machines for handling water, feed, bedding, and manure, as well as for the many special operations involved in producing milk and eggs.

In the early 19th century, animals were the chief source of power in farming. Later in the century, steam power gained in importance. During World War I gasoline- (petrol-) powered tractors became common, and diesel engines later became prevalent. In the developed countries, the number of farm workers has steadily declined in the 20th century, while farm production has increased because of the use of machinery."

livestock farming,  raising of animals for use or for pleasure. In this article, the discussion of livestock includes both beef and dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, mules, asses, buffalo, and camels; the raising of birds commercially for meat or eggs (i.e., chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and squabs) is treated separately. For further information on dairy cattle breeds, feeding and management, see dairying. For a discussion of the food value and processing of meat products, see the article meat processing. For a further discussion of breeds of horses, see the article horse: Breeds of horses.

An efficient and prosperous animal agriculture historically has been the mark of a strong, well-developed nation. Such an agriculture permits a nation to store large quantities of grains and other foodstuffs in concentrated form to be utilized to raise animals for human consumption during such emergencies as war or natural calamity. Furthermore, meat has long been known for its high nutritive value, producing stronger, healthier people.

Ruminant (cud-chewing) animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats convert large quantities of pasture forage, harvested roughage, or by-product feeds, as well as nonprotein nitrogen such as urea, into meat, milk, and wool. Ruminants are therefore extremely important; more than 60 percent of the world’s farmland is in meadows and pasture. Poultry also convert feed efficiently into protein; chickens, especially, are unexcelled in meat and egg production. Milk is one of the most complete and oldest known animal foods. Cows were milked as early as 9000 bce. Hippocrates, the Greek physician, recommended milk as a medicine in the 5th century bce. Sanskrit writings from ancient India refer to milk as one of the most essential human foods.

The British Isles led the world in the development of the principal beef breeds; Herefords, Angus, beef Shorthorns, and Galloways all originated in either England or Scotland. Other breeds of greatest prominence today originated in India (Brahman), France (Charolais; Limousin; Normandy), Switzerland (Simmental), and Africa (Africander). The Hereford breed, considered to be the first to be developed in England, probably descended from white-faced, red-bodied cattle of Holland crossed with the smaller black Celtics that were native to England and especially to Herefordshire. By the middle of the 18th century the slow process of selective breeding that resulted in the smooth, meaty, and prolific Herefords had begun. The United States statesman Henry Clay of Kentucky imported the first purebred Herefords to America in 1817.

The Hereford, which became the most popular beef breed of the United States, is distinguished by its white face, white flanks and underline, white stockings and tail, and white crest on the neck. Its body colour ranges from cherry to mahogany red. It is of medium size, with present-day breeders making successful efforts to increase both its rate of weight gain and mature size, in keeping with the demand for cheaper, leaner beef.

The Polled Hereford is a separate breed of cattle originating from hornless mutations in 1901. It has the same general characteristics as the horned Hereford and has gained substantial favour because of its hornlessness and often faster rate of weight gain.

The Aberdeen Angus breed originated in Scotland from naturally hornless aboriginal cattle native to the counties of Aberdeen and Angus. Solid black, occasionally with a spot of white underneath the rear flanks, the breed is noted for its smoothness, freedom from waste, and high quality of meat.

Although the native home of the Galloway breed is the ancient region of Galloway in southwestern Scotland, it probably had a common origin with the Angus. The Galloway is distinguished by its coat of curly black hair. Though the breed has never attained the prominence of other beef breeds, it has been used extensively in producing blue-gray crossbred cattle, obtained by breeding white Shorthorn bulls to Galloway cows.

The beef, or Scotch, Shorthorn breed developed from early cattle of England and northern Europe, selected for heavy milk production and generally known as Durham cattle. These were later selected for the compact, beefy type by the Scottish breeders. Emphasis on leaner, highquality carcasses in the second half of the 20th century has diminished the popularity of this breed. The Polled Shorthorn originated in 1888 from purebred, hornless mutations of the Shorthorn breed. The milking, or dual-purpose, Shorthorn, representing another segment of the parent Shorthorn breed, also was developed in England to produce an excellent flow of milk as well as an acceptable carcass, therefore resembling the original English type of Shorthorn. Shorthorns range in colour from red through roan, to white- or red-and-white-spotted.

The Brahman breed originated in India, where 30 or more separate varieties exist. Preference is given to the Guzerat, Nellore, Gir, and Krishna Valley strains, which are characterized by a pronounced hump over the shoulders and neck; excessive skin on the dewlap and underline; large, droopy ears; and horns that tend to curve upward and rearward. Their colour ranges from near white through brown and brownish red to near black. Their popularity in other areas such as South America and Europe, into which they have been imported, is attributable mainly to their heat tolerance, drought resistance, and resistance to fever ticks and other insects. The Santa Gertrudis was developed by the King Ranch of Texas by crossing Brahman and Shorthorn cattle to obtain large, hearty, tick-resistant, red cattle that have proved to be popular not only in Texas but in many regions along the semitropical Gulf Coast. Until the tick was eradicated in the southern and southwestern United States, Brahman crosses were raised almost exclusively there.

Several lesser breeds have been developed from crosses of the Brahman on other beef breeds such as: the Charbray (Charolais), Braford (Hereford), Brangus (Angus), Brahorn (Shorthorn), and Beefmaster (Brahman-Shorthorn-Hereford).

The Charolais breed, which originated in the Charolais region of France, has become quite popular in the United States for crossing on the British breeds for production of market cattle. The superior size, rate of gain, and heavy muscling of the pure French Charolais and the hybrid vigour accruing from the crossing of nonrelated breeds promise an increased popularity of this breed. Many American Charolais, however, carry significant amounts of Brahman blood, with a corresponding reduction in size, rate of gain, and muscling. Important in France, the Charolais is the foremost meat-cattle breed in Europe.

The Limousin breed, which originated in west central France, is second in importance to the Charolais as a European meat breed. Limousin cattle, often longer, finer boned, and slightly smaller than the Charolais, are also heavily muscled and relatively free from excessive deposits of fat.

The most prevalent breed of France, the Normandy, is smaller than the Charolais or Limousin and has been developed as a dual-purpose breed useful for both milk and meat production. A fourth important breed is the Maine–Anjou, which is the largest of the French breeds.

The Simmental accounts for nearly half of the cattle of Switzerland, Austria, and the western areas of Germany. Smaller than the Charolais and Limousin, the Simmental was developed for milk, meat, and draft. It is yellowish brown or red with characteristic white markings."

intensive agriculture,   in agricultural economics, system of cultivation using large amounts of labour and capital relative to land area. Large amounts of labour and capital are necessary to the application of fertilizer, insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides to growing crops, and capital is particularly important to the acquisition and maintenance of high-efficiency machinery for planting, cultivating, and harvesting, as well as irrigation equipment where that is required.

Optimal use of these materials and machines produces significantly greater crop yields per unit of land than extensive agriculture, which uses little capital or labour. As a result, a farm using intensive agriculture will require less land than an extensive agriculture farm to produce a similar profit. In practice, however, the increased economies and efficiencies of intensive agriculture often encourage farm operators to work very large tracts in order to keep their capital investments in machinery productively engaged—i.e., busy.

On the level of theory, the increased productivity of intensive agriculture enables the farmer to use a relatively smaller land area that is located close to market, where land values are high relative to labour and capital, and this is true in many parts of the world. If costs of labour and capital outlays for machinery and chemicals, and costs of storage (where desired or needed) and transportation to market are too high then farmers may find it more profitable to turn to extensive agriculture.

However, in practice many relatively small-scale farmers employ some combination of intensive and extensive agriculture, and many of these operate relatively close to markets. Many large-scale farm operators, especially in such relatively vast and agriculturally advanced nations as Canada and the United States, practice intensive agriculture in areas where land values are relatively low, and at great distances from markets, and farm enormous tracts of land with high yields. However, in such societies overproduction (beyond market demands) often results in diminished profit as a result of depressed prices."

This is the Complete Green grams farming guide to enable you start and grow your green grams for domestic or commercial purposes. Green grams alternatively known as the green gram, maash, moong, monggo, or munggo, is a plant species in the legume family. The mung bean is mainly cultivated in East, Southeast and South Asia. It is used as an ingredient in both savoury and sweet dishes. Wikipedia Before venturing into green grams farming in Kenya or anywhere there are a variety of questions you have asked yourselves, we intend to guide you on green gram farming and answer all these questions here.

HOW TO GROW GREEN GRAMS IN KENYA

Green grams are best grown at an altitude of 0-1600m above sea level well adapted to sandy loam and clayey soils at pH range of 5.5-7.5. They are drought tolerant with rain fall requirement range between 350- 700mm/annum. Heavy rain fall results to increased vegetative growth with reduced pod setting and development. Most parts of Kitui County are favorable for growing green grams.

There are various varieties of green grams grown in Kenya listed below

PLANTING

Land should be ploughed during the dry spell to allow for aeration and expose soil borne pests to die. Soil clods should be broken to medium tilth to create a soil structure that encourages seedlings emerge/germinate uniformly and rapidly. Manure should be applied at a rate 200 wheel barrows per acre. Terracing should be done during land preparation to reduce surface run off and moisture retention for crop sustenance.

Propagation of green grams is by seeds. Seeds are planted at a spacing of 45*15cm, a depth of about 3-5cm, An acre needs 4-6kg of green gram seeds. Germination occurs within 5-7 days and this depend on the variety and environmental factors. When using oxen plough for planting, place the seed at the side of furrow. Practice crop rotation because green grams have toxic residues and disease organisms that may affect the crop.

Foliar feeds should be applied before flowering and at fruiting stage to boost yield.

After planting your green grams regulars farm practices continues which include;

FARM PRACTICES FOR GREEN GRAM FARMING

Weeding

Weeding of green grams is done by uprooting unwanted plants that grows with the green grams to ensure that pest and diseases are prevented and also competition for nutrients with plants are reduced and discouraged. When the crop begins flowering, weeding should be minimizes in order to prevent disturbances.

GREEN GRAMS PESTS AND DISEASES

GREEN GRAMS HARVESTING

Green grams mature within 60-90 days after sowing, depending on environmental factors as well as the variety. Physiological maturity harvesting is the stage of growth in which the plant has completed its physiological development or when it has developed enough to provide a useful products to the farmer. Harvesting is generally done by hand-picking at weekly intervals. The legumes are harvested when the seed pod s are dry, shriveled and the seeds inside are hard. You can pick and dry individual pods or uproot the whole plant and dry it for about two days, then thresh and clean. Harvesting is the most expensive process in growing green grams. Threshing –can be done using either mechanical or manual methods, in mechanical u can use pulse thresher which makes work easier and faster, manually u can use beating stick. To avoid dirt and foreign materials spread on polythene paper. Winnow to separate grains from foreign materials.

GREEN GRAMS MARKET

High demand for green grams crops has provided ready market for this kind of crop. Price of green grams ranges from 40 to ksh.100 per kg depending on quality, seasonality and market forces of demand and supply. Green grams can be sold in;

The suitable seeding rate for sorghum is An acre needs 4-6kg of green gram seeds. Green grams produces 3 to 4 bags of 90kg per acre.

The simple steps and full guide on How to graft purple passion fruits the right way for maximum production Grafting refers to propagating, or reproducing, a plant from the parts of two parent plants: a rootstock and a scion. The grafted plant shares qualities of both parent plants; grafting is commonly used to produce plants with more fruit production and disease resistance than the donors.

Rootstock: Rootstock of the purple passion fruit is the base and root portion of a grafted plant. It’s grafted onto the scion.

Scion: This is the flowering or fruiting part of the purple passion fruit plant which is grafted onto rootstock in order to create a new plant with superior qualities.

GRAFTING PURPLE PASSION FRUITS

This type of passion fruit is most suited to upper midland and highlands (1,100 to 2,500m above sea level). It has purple color, superior fruits of 4-5 cm in diameter which have an aromatic flavor. It is good for fresh market and Juice extraction for local and export markets.

Purple passion fruit production is constrained by several insect pests, diseases and inadequate knowledge on the management of the crop among other factors leading to lower potential that’s why grafting of its seedlings is done.

What you need

GRAFTING

Make a 1 1/2-inch-long, wide cut partway through the main stem of the purple passion fruit seedling 10 to 12 inches above the soil line using the utility knife. This will serve as the graft’s rootstock. Ensure you find the softer part of the stem. Ensure also that this part of the rootstock has no leaves.

Remove leaves of the main stem of a purple passion fruit plant until you are left only with the top part with two main leaves using the utility knife. This are vines of purple passion fruit collected preferably when the plants have flowered from a healthy high yielding purple passion fruit.

Ensure this part measures 30 to 40 cm. This piece serves as the graft’s scion. Cut the softer part in an area with the same diameter as the root stock in a V shaped manner the way you sharpen a pencil

Position the cut surface of the scion – the exposed vascular tissue known as the cambia – against the cut surface of the rootstock. Wrap the union of the rootstock and the scion firmly three to four times with grafting tape or the polythene paper.

You can now place the grafted passion fruit outside in a shaded area after the outside temperature reaches 65 degrees F.

AFTER GRAFTING PURPLE PASSION FRUIT

The grafted Seedlings should be watered regularly and protected from insects also harden-off seedlings by exposing them to the sun gradually when scion shoot grows about 10cm long.  Remove grafting tape from the union and transplant seedling in the field one month after grafting. At this time also your grafted seedlings are ready for sale this seedlings always fetch a higher price and you can make yourself a fortune either by farming or selling the seedlings.

Popularly known as a Common man’s ‘Cow’ or goats are among the main meat-producing animals in India. Its meat (chevon) is one of the choicest meats which have huge domestic demand. Goat farming generally means, rearing goats for the purpose of harvesting milk, meat and fiber.

Popularly known as a Common man’s ‘Cow’ or goats are among the main meat-producing animals in India. Its meat (chevon) is one of the choicest meats which have huge domestic demand. Goat farming generally means, rearing goats for the purpose of harvesting milk, meat and fiber. Rearing of goats is not a new enterprise and the process has been taken place since the time immemorial.  

Rearing goats is a profitable business. Due to its good economic prospects, goat rearing under intensive and semi-intensive system for commercial production is gaining momentum for the couple of years.  

It should be noted that, high demand for goat and its products with potential of good economic returns are deriving many progressive farmers, businessmen, professionals, ex-servicemen and educated youths to take up the goat enterprise on a commercial scale. 

Currently, goat farming has become a profitable business and requires a very low investment due to its multi-functional utility. Also, commercial goat farming business is contributing to the economy and nutrition of a country in a big way. 

We all know that goats are multi-functional animals. One can produce a wide variety of products from them like, milk, meat, fiber, manure etc. The milk of goat is used for producing full cream goat powder, skimmed goat milk powder, goat butter, goat milk cream, fresh goat milk etc. 

However, goat meat is a great source of consumable meat which is very tasty, nutritious and healthy. Also goat’s wool is used in various purposes and its skin plays a crucial role in leather industry. 

Do you know the advantages of goat farming business? And tips to become a successful goat farmer? How you can start a profitable goat farming business? This article will provide answers to all these queries and will definitely help you to find great opportunities in this business.

There are many advantages and disadvantages of goat farming

1. Goat Products are Healthy & Easily Digestible: 

Goat products such as milk and meat are not only nutritious and easily digestible but are also a great source of regular income for the poor, landless and marginal farmers. It contributes immensely in rural economy and national income. Its meat and milk are cholesterol free and easily digestible. Goat milk is used for making different types of foods. They can produce milk, meat, skin, fiber and manure at the same time. 

2. Easy Maintenance & Less Capital: 

Small sized animal, goats are very easily maintained and cared by women and children. For being a successful goat farmer, one needs to do some common tasks like, feeding, milking and caring. These tasks do not require much equipment, capital, labor or hard work.  Their return of investment ratio is also very good. As goat farming business is very profitable, hence many government and non government banks are giving loans for starting this business. 

3. Don’t Require a Huge Area: 

Goats don’t require a huge area for housing due to their small body size. They can easily share their living place with their owners or his/her other livestock animals. Adding to it, goats are very suitable for mixed farming with other domestic animals.  

4. Good Breeders: 

Goats are not only very friendly and lovable in nature, but are excellent breeders too. You will be surprised to know that they reach sexual maturity within their 7-12 months of age and give birth to kids within a short time period. Also, some goat breed produces many kids per kidding.  

5. Less Risk: 

It is good to know that there is less risk even in drought prone areas for goat farming. It is not true in any other livestock farming business. Goats can be milked as often as required. This also prevents refrigeration costs and milk storage problems. 

6. Equal Price in Market: 

Do you know that both male and female goats have almost equal value/price in the market? Well Yes! It is true. Also, there is no religious taboo against goat farming and meat consumption. Therefore, commercial goat farming business has developed a potential way of employment for unemployed people. 

Their meat has a huge demand and high price in the local and international markets. You can also consider exporting your products to the foreign countries for more profits.  

7. Good Adaptability & Less Prone to Diseases: 

Goats are very much capable of adopting themselves with almost all types of agro climatic environments and conditions. They can even bear high and low temperature throughout the world and live happily. Adding to it, they can tolerate to hot climate more than any other animals. Diseases are also less in goats as compared to other domestic animals.  

8. Best Milk Producers: 

Due to this quality, goats are popularly called as the “foster mother of human”. Their milk is considered as the best milk for human consumption than any other species of livestock animal’s milk. The milk is low cost, nutritious, wholesome and easily digestible. In fact, all aged people from child to old can easily digest goat’s milk. Goat milk also has lesser allergic problems. It is also used as an Ayurvedic medicine for the people who are ailing with diabetes, asthma, cough etc. 

To be a Successful Goat Farmer and to start your own farm, you must know these things: 

1. Right Location:  

To find correct location is the first and most important point to be taken care of. Though, common goats generally survive in warm areas that are well drained. Besides temperature, space is also necessary. Goat lives in groups, hence individual pens are not effective. A large field is needed if you want your animals to roam freely. Such goats usually have better resistance to sickness and infection.  

The best locations considered for a goat farm are far from towns as urban pollution is dangerous to animal health. As goats eats a lot of grass on a daily basis. So, one must make sure their food source is highly accessible and not too far from the rearing area. 

2. Land Requirement:  

Goats can be reared intensively on small acreage by using supplemental feed. If you are using an extensive system, then 2 to 10 goats per acre is a rough guide depending on the supply of grass and brush.  

3. Goat Breed:  

There are breeds which produce more milk while there are others that grow quickly. Therefore, depending on your purpose, choose the type of breed you want to rear. You can also farm both types of breeds and you will be harvesting both meat and milk.  

However, you must note that different breeds require different levels of care. Do research and consult an expert so he can guide you to decide what will be best for your farm. 

4. Veterinarian: 

Easy access to a veterinarian plays an important role. When starting a goat farm, there are chances your animals to contract diseases. Thus, a veterinarian can help in disease control and management to avoid losses. They help you diagnose diseases or recommend vitamins and supplements to keep your animals in good health especially during stressful situations like weaning. 

5. Proper Food & Housing: 

Goats are very choosy with food. They don’t eat dried or soiled grass. You must make sure to have enough clean, fresh grass for them so they don’t go hungry. It is well known that goats are not carnivorous animal. They usually prefer to eat grasses, plants, shrubs, weeds and herbs. Goats also need energy, portion, vitamins, fiber and water for proper growth. 

A well-designed barn or shed and good management, will help you to reap all the profit from goat farming. Always keep the house neat, clean and dry. Arrange proper ventilation and drainage system inside the house. Ensure the availability of sufficient fresh air and light inside the house. 

6.  Good Transportation: 

A market near the farm land will be best, as it will help you to sell your products easily and buy necessary commodities. 

7. Care & Management: 

Always try to take proper care of your goats. Never feed them contaminated food or polluted water. Keep their house as much neat and clean as possible. Do clean their house on a regular basis. Take extra care to the breeding bucks, kids and pregnant does. Keep the kids with their mother for several weeks after their birth. 

Don’t use same buck for mating with numerous does at same day. Artificial insemination is also a good way for breeding your does. Vaccinate them on timely basis, to keep them free from all types of diseases and health problems. Keep a stock of some necessary vaccines and medicines.  

8. Vaccination: 

Many types of viral diseases like PPR, goat pox, foot and mouth diseases and bacterial diseases like anthrax, brucelosis etc. are very harmful for goats. Thus, proper vaccination is a must to prevent these types of diseases. The does which was not vaccinated PPR, goat pox, brucellosis vaccines previously, vaccinate them at the fifth month of gestation period. You must vaccinate the kids PPR vaccine when they reach 5 months of age.  

9. Total Expenditure & Profit: 

Total expenditure and profit from goat farming business is totally dependent on the farming system, location, breeds, feeding cost and few other factors. With good planning and proper management one can easily make goat farming business profitable. On one hand, small scale farming requires less investment and profit can contribute your regular income. 

On the other hand, large scale or commercial production requires high investment and some other additional costs.  

 

Read and do proper research and planning on how to raise goats.

Maintain good and strong health of your goats.

Choose the right and high productive goat breeds for your business.

Learn more about goat farming business from the nearest livestock training center or expert producers.

Goats like to live in groups. Hence, ensure a big area so that they can roam freely.

There should be availability of all equipments which are essential for goat farms.

Make sure a well bred conduct, to produce better milk, meat and to keep the goat free from diseases.

As per their daily demand, give them sufficient clean water, food and fresh grasses.

Never feed goats with contaminated food or polluted water.

Take extra care to the pregnant doe, breeding buck and kids.

Feed the buck extra nutritious food during the period of mating.

To improve your goat’s health contact visit a veterinarian regularly (if it’s possible).

During the summer season, provide them salt and mineral with a lot of water.

Keep them away from cold and rain to avoid mass death.

Although, there are some risk in every business. But, taking proper care and good management can ensure better production and high profit. Goat farming can be concluded as a traditional, profitable, risk-less and very easy business because of its multi-utility and fast growing rate. They are also used as a tool for poverty reduction and play a crucial role in the economic growth of a country.

Three goats, a buck and two does, nibble on Napier grass placed on the ground as Christopher Makana, the owner, looks on.

Makana, who keeps the goats in Mumias East, Kakamega County, smiles as the animals seemingly compete to chew the grass. He adds more to ensure each feeds to their fill.

Makana, a disabled farmer, keeps the animals for milk and sells the kids whenever need arises.

“These animals have given me not only a peace of mind but also financial independence,” he says.

He received them in 2019 from Agro-Kenya, an organisation that works with smallholder farmers in western Kenya.

In particular, the organisation works with farmers living with disabilities in Mumias East through a revolving programme, where one offers the first kid the goats’ births to the next beneficiary.

Suleiman Kweyu, the founder of Agro-Kenya, notes that he started with eight farmers but now works with over 50 of them, who are living with hearing, walking and visual impairments.

“I work with 56 disabled farmers through a support group called Mumias East Disability Project. They rear the goats for a living,” adds Kweyu, the managing director of Agro-Kenya.

The goat project earned him a fellowship last year, where he was one of 30 Kenyans selected to participate in the African Food Fellowship (AFF), a continent-wide initiative of African leaders actively contributing to food systems transformation.

The fellowship brings together aspiring leaders from different backgrounds ranging from agri-finance, horticulture and aquaculture to shape agendas and set priorities for investment, policy and action in the agriculture sector.

Kweyu, who holds a masters degree in financial economics, says he started the project by profiling farmers with disabilities to know their geographical location, type of impairment and most importantly their unique needs.

“We held meetings with them and identified the kind of support they required. The eight farmers I started with identified dairy goats as their preferred the venture because the animals mature faster, don’t require big land and are easy to manage as compared to cows,” he says. Agro-Kenya then provided them with training on best goat management practises that included feeding and housing.

According to him, he invested some Sh20,000 in the project, buying eight Small East African Goats for the farmers and today, each keeps three to five animals.

The farmers were trained on how to provide goats with a dry, comfortable, safe and secure house.

Suleiman Kweyu. The director of Agro-Kenya.

“The houses must protect the goats from thieves, predators, excessive heat and harsh weather. Typically, a goat eats 3 to 5 per cent of its body weight in dry matter daily. To ingest that much, goats should be reared where lots of forage is available because they like eating woody plants and weeds,” says Kweyu.

The institution received a boost from the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro) – Naivasha, International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and Maseno University, which offer support to the project.  Having loved their model, the first two donated Toggenburg bucks in 2020 to ensure the farmers end up with highly productive animals.

He notes farmers with milk producing goats get at least three litres per day that is sold locally at Sh60 each.   “Our aim is to aid farmers end up with up to six goats in a year if the animals kid triplets twice a year,” he says. 

Makana, who hails from Ebubele village, keeps five goats. “In the first year, it sired two kids and the next, one. Today, I have five after selling others to pay school fees for my children who are in forms four, three and one,” says Makana.

He adds that the project is not only helping them financially, but also offering them peer support.

John Khata, the secretary of Mumias East Disability Project, says the goat initiative has made him financially stable.

“Goats kid two or three young ones, what makes one increase their herd faster,” he says.

Kweyu notes that having received mentorship, as an AFF fellow, he has committed to support farmers to improve food security as well as change lives through agriculture.

Agro-Kenya, according to him, is working on scaling up the project to other parts of Kakamega County and the neighbouring Bungoma, Busia and Vihiga.

The objective is to reach out and recruit up to 5,000 people living with disabilities to provide support to the unique segment of farmers who have been technically marginalised and ignored by most actors in the agriculture sector. 

Shadrack Emali, a veterinary officer in Kakamega County, says fast-shrinking land sizes in the county makes goat keeping a viable business.

“Kakamega is a county with a lot of green shrubs necessary for goat rearing. Goats provide a regular source of income especially if they are being milked.”

 He adds, “Farmers not only get milk from the goats but also meat and they can sell the kids for more income.”

Okra cultivation is very common and popular all over the world. Okra cultivation is a very lucrative and easy money-making business. Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), also called Bhendi, is a popular vegetable worldwide. High demand for nutrients, either from soil organic matter or fertilizers.

A long pod set requires a constant supply of nitrogen. Side dress at least once after the pods begin to form. Okra is a fast-growing, erect herbaceous annual and belongs to the Malvaceae family. It is an important vegetable crop grown in the tropics and subtropics of the world. Let’s check out the fertilizer management for Okra below.

The use of poultry manure, cow dung, and compost has increased the organic matter in the soil and improved both the physical and chemical properties of the soil compared to inorganic fertilizer and control alone. Poultry manure has been identified as an organic fertilizer better than cow dung and manure for the production of Okra. Therefore, fertilizers are added to the soil to provide the essential elements for plant growth. 

Organic fertilizers are usually obtained from animal or plant sources. They are the best sources of organic matter, but you can use organic fertilizers such as compost tea during the relatively short period of growing nutrients. You can also side-dress with compost every 3-4 weeks. Apply 10-10-10 fertilizer or household fertilizer to a depth of 4 inches into the ground with a shovel, about 3 ounces for every 100 square feet of land. The fertilizer label indicates the percentage of the three main nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. 

In case you missed it: Guide to Growing Okra/Bhendi in Texas: For Beginners, Soil Preparation to Harvest

The three nutrient numbers on the fertilizer package are called NPK Value. The letter N is given by nitrogen, P by phosphorus, and K by potassium, essential nutrients for plants. Okra is a popular vegetable grown for its pods and leaves. It has been found that the continuous application of nitrogen fertilizers increases soil acidity and reduces the nutrient and yield of Okra. 

Fertilizer application depends on soil fertility and the amount of organic fertilizer applied to the crop. About 20-25 tons of FYM per hectare is added during land preparation. Generally, it is recommended to use 100 kg N, 60 kg P2O5, and 50 kg K2O for maximum yield. Half the N and the full dose of P2O5 and K2O are applied at the cultivation time. Half if given 30 days after sowing and after that perform earthing up operation.

Excessive nitrogen can prevent flowering, while phosphorus fertilizers can promote flowering. Okra is beneficial in adding nitrogen and phosphorus. Farmers usually apply ammonium phosphate fertilizer, which contains both nutrients at 100 pounds per acre before sowing. Chemical fertilizer can be replaced with chicken manure one week before planting. An additional 40-60 lb nitrogen side dressing can be applied six weeks after planting. 

A deep narrow furrow is opened on one side of each sowing edge and fertilized. Nitrogen fertilizers like urea, calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), and ammonium sulfate should be used for the Okra crop. The recommended doses for hybrid varieties are 150 kg N, 112 kg P2O5, and 75 kg K2O. 30% N and 50% P&K are used as basal doses of this diet. The remaining 50% P and 40% N, and 25% K are applied as the first top dressing four weeks after sowing.

A balance of 30% N and 25% K is applied as a second top dressing about seven weeks after sowing. Further use of calcium nitrate may be required later, depending on rainfall and how long Okra production is expected. It is important to provide extra nitrogen at the end of the season when the flowers are concentrated on the top of the plant.

In case you missed it: Red Okra vs Green Okra: Which Makes You Rich?

Nitrogen is an important macronutrient for plant function. It is an important component of amino acids, which form the building blocks of plant proteins and enzymes. Proteins make up the structural material of all living things, and enzymes facilitate a wide range of biochemical reactions within plants. Also, nitrogen is a component of the chlorophyll molecule, enabling plants to receive sunlight energy through light synthesis, promoting plant growth and pod production. 

Nitrogen plays an important role inside the plant in ensuring that energy is available when and where the plant needs the energy to improve yields. This important nutrient is also present in the roots as proteins and enzymes help regulate water and nutrient intake. Two top nitrogen dressings – 20 pounds per acre for each top-dress – should provide enough nitrogen for the crop three weeks after the first plant emergence, then three weeks later. 

Another way to manage nitrogen is to inject it through a drip irrigation system used to irrigate the crop. The advantage of applying nitrogen through a drip system is that a small amount of nitrogen can be applied more regularly, thus reducing the risk of over-application of nitrogen and reducing nitrogen loss by leaching from heavy rains. 

Also, less nitrogen will be available for weed competitors, as nitrogen is applied at the bottom of the row and is not spread over a wide area. Even if fertilizer is applied through the drip irrigation system, it is wise to plant nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in advance based on soil test recommendations.

Okra grows well in soils that are rich in nutrients. You can improve your soil by adding fertilizers. Okra grows in the best soil, which is also loose and well-drained. Although sandy, light soils are ideal for oats, they should be modified with organic matter to enhance nutrition and water retention. Okra grows best in loam-based compost. The soil should be able to dry out slightly and not be constantly wet. You do not want the pot to overflow, or you will have a problem with root rot. 

In case you missed it: Okra Pests, Diseases, Symptoms, And Control Measures

Okra plants do not like to get wet. Make a fertile bed with free drainage soil with lots of organic matter, including compost. Add organic fertilizer with nitrogen to help the plant continue to produce pods. Adding nitrogen to the soil from mid to late season can be helpful. Okra uses a lot of energy to make pods, and the extra nitrogen can increase their yield. Choose a complete fertilizer, organic if possible. It grows well in many soil types.

It helps to start with standard soils; however, the weight of Okra pods, the nutrients in the pods, the amount of ash, the length of the root, and the grains used to improve soil fertility, wood ash, and cocoa. Straw was the most effective, while rice bran and sawdust were the least effective. For maximum growth, spray organic fertilizer 4-6 weeks after planting.

The use of organic fertilizers will help increase pod production. Heavy rains can wash away past use of fertilizers, depleting nutrients for plants in the soil. When growing Okra in containers, make sure that the nutrients are released faster. Therefore, you may need to re-apply fertilizer more often. 

Too much nitrogen in the soil will cause excessive plant growth and delay flowering and fruit set, so do not use too much nitrogen. Okra will respond to nitrogen fertilizer, so top dressing with nitrogen fertilizer is recommended. Fertilizer as a side dressing when the Okra plants are 6 to 8 inches tall and replant with fertilizer after two to three weeks. Side dressing is a way to provide the required fertilizer during very strong growth. 

Though, dig a shallow trench six inches from the plant base and apply granular compost at the bottom of the trench, following the package instructions for the appropriate amount. Cover the manure with soil. Water the trench well so that the manure melts and soaks into the root zone.

Okra can grow in poor soils but push out more flowers and pods with higher nutrient levels. Many agricultural extensions recommend 10-10-10 fertilizers, but any regular fertilizer with equal numbers (or the first number slightly higher) will suffice. 

You can apply the same balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season, but always follow the instructions on the package. Applying more fertilizer will harm the production of Okra more than under fertilization. Although high phosphorus fertilizers are ideal for flower and fruit growth, Okra pods appear on new growing shoots, and nitrogen promotes more shoot growth, so more balanced fertilizers are often recommended. 

In case you missed it: Organic Okra Farming (Bhindi/Lady Finger), Cultivation

Symptoms – Plants are stunned. The leaves are smaller than usual. The leaves are yellow. The shoots are thin. The pods are hard. 

Control – Use the maximum amount of nitrogen fertilizer. A soil test can determine fertilizer dosage. In the absence of soil testing. 40 – 150 kg N / hectare can be applied. Spray three or four foliar sprays with 1% urea solution at 10-day intervals. Six foliar sprays with 2% urea solution at seven days starting from 20 days after sowing. 

Symptoms – The leaves are dark green. Plants are stunned. 

Control – Maximum use of phosphorus fertilizer. A soil test can determine dosage. In the absence of soil testing. 8-75 kg P2O5 /hectare can be applied. 

Symptoms – The number of leaves is low. The margins of the leaves are brownish yellow, brown or scorched. Burning of scorched leaves. Decreases plant growth. The old leaves turn yellow and marginal chlorosis is present. 

Control – Maximum use of potassium fertilizer. The soil test can determine dosage. 20 to 75 kg of potash per hectare can be used without soil testing. Foliar spray of KCl by 1% 

Symptoms – Okra leaves become distorted and brittle. They are small in size and have irregular pod growth. Pods are like small stumps. They do not last long but stay connected for a long time. The leaves begin to fall off. Plant growth stops. Distortion of new leaves (in severe cases, the growing point dies) and the appearance of a wide yellow border on the margins of old leaves. Stagnant growth and thick yellow long lines formed in the skin markings.  

Control – Foliar spray of 0.2% borax at clear intervals. Applying 10 kg borax per hectare on previously deficient land will prevent boron deficiency.

Symptoms – Decreased plant growth; Chlorosis occurs in young leaves. 

Control – Foliar spray of FeSO4 by 0.5% 

In case you missed it: Okra Farming Cost, Profits (Bhindi) – A Project Report

Symptoms – Manganese deficient plants have medium to upper leaf veins that appear green against a faint light green to the yellow blade. 

Correction – Spray the foliage with MnSO4 by 0.1% (100 g / 100 L water) on plants. 

Symptoms – Marked depression in leaf production and leaf size occurs within three weeks, and leaf mottling develops after two weeks. The diameter of the stem was reduced.

Correction – Foliar spray of ZnSO4 0.5% or soil application of 10kg ZnSO4 / hectare.

The use of urea fertilizer and goat manure has led to increased growth and production of Okra due to the increasing availability of organic matter and nutrients in the soil. 

The use of organic fertilizers will help increase pod production. Composting around the plant in the middle of the season will help it to keep growing. 

Coffee grounds are a suitable organic amendment for growing Okra when used directly on soil or in composted material. Coffee ground helps improve soil texture or tilth and increases soil nutrient density when used with other organic modifications.

Some people add Epsom salt to Okra, but it is not recommended globally. Epsom salts are made up of sulfur and magnesium, two ingredients from which Okra can benefit. However, when applying Epsom salt to Okra, care should be taken as it can easily kill Okra plants if used excessively. Use common fertilizer instead of Epsom salt for Okra.

The planting season should bring joy to farmers as they sow seeds in the soil and wait for them to sprout.

Over the years, when the rains were regular and fertiliser and seeds, among other inputs, were readily available and affordable, farmers cherished the season. Not anymore as they struggle to access the inputs amid the ravaging effects of climate change like erratic rains.

Read: Call to cut fertiliser prices as cost of living shoots up 

Agriculture CS Peter Munya appeared to have brought some joy to farmers a month ago when he announced that the government would provide subsidised fertiliser to cushion farmers from high costs.

But Seeds of Gold has established that the subsidised fertiliser, both for planting and top-dressing, has eluded farmers not only because of excessive red tape and shortage, but also unscrupulous businessmen have found a way to beat the system and milk the producers dry.

A farmer puts fertilizer and maize seeds in a tractor planter in Mariashoni, Nakuru County, in this photo taken on April 16, 2022. 

In short, thousands of small-scale farmers have not benefited from the subsidised fertiliser that Munya say they can buy up to 40 50kg bags each from the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) stores, having increased the number from 20.

Read: Subsidised fertiliser: Farmers allege unfair distribution

Farmers say that the process of acquiring the commodity is extremely tedious. To begin with, they must register with their local chiefs by giving details of their farm’s acreage, ownership, location and type of crops they want to plant to get a clearance note from the Ministry of Agriculture.

But that is not all, they must be members of a registered cooperative society or group comprising at least 10 people. In a country where few farmers are members of a cooperative society, most of them are being left out.

And the fact that it takes up to a week to register such an outfit at the Ministry of Agriculture means farmers who were timing the rains to plant had no option but to give up.

The worst of it all is that unscrupulous dealers, the so-called cartels, have taken advantage of the situation to buy the fertiliser in bulk as they have the money and the means of transport.

They then repackage and sell at Sh6,000 instead of the subsidised price of Sh2,800 per 50kg bag.

""I was shocked when an agrovet owner insisted that I can only buy the fertiliser at Sh6,000. I sent him Sh8,400 for three bags via Mpesa but he returned the money,"" said Elizabeth Mukami, a farmer at Wanyororo in Bahati, Nakuru County.

She has about three acres that she had prepared ahead of the onset of the rains and needed at least three 50kg bags of DAP fertiliser.

Read: Why food crisis remains a thorn in flesh for Kenya

According to her, agents of fertiliser traders visited her area and recorded names of those farmers who were late in planting promising to bring them the government fertiliser from NCPB, Nakuru depot. But she has realised this was a ploy to know the demand in the area and exploit them.

In Subukia, a farmer said he teamed up with another to buy a 50kg of government planting fertiliser at Sh6,000.

""I could not afford the Sh6,000 yet I needed to make good use of the rains.  I met an equally frustrated farmer like me at an agrovet shop and we jointly bought a 50kg bag of DAP and shared equally,"" said John Kipchumba, who grows maize on an acre.

Thomas Kirui, a farmer in Salgaa, said trying to get the government fertiliser is too expensive.

""One does not only incur high transport charges because the NCPB depots are far but also has to buy the input at an increased price of Sh6,000 for a 50kg bag,"" he said.

In the North Rift, Kenya's breadbasket, a severe shortage of the input has hurt planting as well as ongoing top dressing.

Members of one cooperative society told Seeds of Gold that despite booking for several bags of top dressing fertiliser a week ago, they have not been able to access the commodity. ""We needed 100 bags, visited NCPB stores in Uasin Gishu last week and wanted to pay for the commodity but we only accessed 20 bags,"" said Peter Kibet, an official of the Moiben-based Bandaptai Farmers’ Cooperative Society, which has 50 members. In the region, a 50 kilo bag of urea is going for between Sh7,000 and Sh7,500. Besides urea, farmers also need CAN for top-dressing, with a 50kg bag going for between Sh5,000 and Sh6,000.

A fertiliser agent in Nakuru said that he was forced to maintain the Sh6,000 price on government fertiliser due to inflation.

Read: Leaders want cheap fertiliser imported, distributed early

“We’re slowly recovering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and most of us have dead stock of many farming inputs because farmers are not buying, that is why we are insisting on a higher price to recover,” said the agent.

While terming the turn of events unfortunate, NCPB communications manager Titus Maiyo said the agency has no control over the exploitation of farmers.

“This is unfortunate but NCPB has no control of prices once it distributes the fertiliser to its agents,” he said. He refuted claims that NCPB is demanding farmers to form groups of 10 before they are issued with planting and top-dressing fertilisers.

“As long as a farmer is registered and we confirm the details, NCPB has no objection to selling even a single bag. NCPB does not attach unnecessary conditions to impede the farmers from buying the subsidised fertiliser,” added Maiyo.

Seeds of Gold has established that it is the fertiliser agents who are asking farmers to form groups and once they know the demand, they buy the input in bulk from NCPB, repackage and sell at high prices.

Due to the challenges, the annual maize production this season is expected to stand at 4 million 90kg bags in Uasin Gishu County.

Last year, the county produced 4.9 million bags, according to the Agriculture executive Samuel Yego.

He said that the devolved unit is projecting a drop in production due to the rising cost of farm inputs such as fertiliser and fuel.

In Trans Nzoia, Agriculture executive Mary Nzomo said that they are projecting a decline in yields of up to 30 per cent as farmers failed to access crop and soil specific fertilisers in the market due to high costs and shortages.

“In fact, some farmers planted without fertiliser while others used manure which is a slow-release fertiliser. We encourage farmers to use foliar feed to help boost their crops,” stated Dr Nzomo.

She observed that as farmers prepare for top-dressing period, there is anticipated shortage of the commodity since ammonia; a key component in the fertiliser is in short supply because countries like Turkey and Ukraine, where the raw material is sourced are not exporting the ingredient.

“Top-dressing is critical for maize crop, under-usage of fertiliser leads to low productivity,” noted the official.

Kipkorir Menjo, a Kenya Farmers Association official, asked the government to mop up stocks of the top-dressing fertiliser in all stations and distribute to areas where the commodity is needed most.

Farmers asked NCPB to blacklist such rogue agents exploiting them.

Welcome!"
23,Agriculture,"Margaret Njenga at her farm in Kiserian, Kajiado County. She grows onions, capsicum, tomatoes, spinach, cabbages, collard greens and beetroots. 


By 
Peter Changtoek




A cool breeze wafts from the plains yonder as one approaches Corner Baridi in Kiserian, Kajiado County.

The area is cool, as the name loosely suggests. Tens of bungalows and maisonettes dot the area, owned by Kenyans seeking serenity as they work in Nairobi, where life is fast-paced.

However, Corner Baridi is not only a residential hub, commercial farming has taken root here with residents like Margaret Njenga leading from the front. 

The 35-year-old farmer is busy on her onion farm with workers when the Seeds of Gold team arrives, cutting off leaves of the plants to get bulbs for the market.

“This is the last day of harvesting,"" says Margaret as she supervises her 27 workers having reduced the number from 40 the previous day. ""I have done the harvesting in two days.""

Besides onions, Margaret also farms on her four acres capsicums, cabbages, spinach, collard greens, tomatoes, beetroots as well as lucerne for her five dairy cows. 

She also keeps goats, chickens, rabbits and ornamental birds. 

The young farmer, an alumnus of St Johns Teachers Training College in Kilimambogo, quit teaching to engage in mixed farming. “I taught for about four years, then Covid-19 happened in March 2020. When schools were shut, I moved to Kiserian, my parents home and started to farm. I quit teaching to concentrate on farming after realising it’s well-paying,"" says Margaret, who initially was doing telephone farming while teaching.

Onions are her favourite crop due to their good returns. She farms them under irrigation on one acre. The rest of the crops sit on about quarter-acre each.

""I started farming onions on half-acre, investing Sh200,000 capital, money that went on installing drip lines, preparing the farm and buying seeds,"" she explains.

Read: Gilad Millo’s new song on garlic farming

She then expanded to another half-acre, where she increased the number of drip lines for more yields, spending Sh270,000.

Seeds are among the most expensive input, she says, noting she buys a kilo at Sh30,000.

The crop takes 45 days in the nursery and 90 days in the field after transplanting, adds Margaret.

According to her, she harvests up to 15 tonnes of onions, up from eight that she would get when she was a telephone farmer.

She is currently selling a kilo of the onions at Sh70, what she says is one of the best prices as she once sold at Sh30.

“For onions, the worst thing you can do is to grow them on a small portion. It is better to invest Sh200,000 and farm on an acre, two or three. The higher the tonnage, the higher the income.""

But management of the crop greatly determines what one harvests. 

""When you get 15 tonnes every four to five months, that comes to over Sh1 million and you can have three seasons in a year,"" she says.

She sells the onions to traders from Wakulima Market in Nairobi who visit her farm.

“They collect them from the farm. It is the same case with tomatoes,” says the farmer.

She rotates onions with tomatoes or cabbages that take three months to mature. “The advantage of mixed farming is that you can’t fail to get some money. Onions take some four months to mature. As I’m waiting, I sell cabbages and tomatoes, thus get income through out the year like a salaried person,"" she says.

Margaret grows her own seedlings inside a greenhouse in trays, cutting her cost of production.

“I grow collard greens and cabbages to get money for my sustanance and to run the farm but onions are my main crop.”

She uses manure from her livestock to grow the crops and buys more from her neighbours. She says soil testing is vital, as it guided her not to use DAP.

“I can’t use DAP according to the soil analysis report. I plant with manure, and after two weeks, I apply CAN. After four weeks I apply NPK,” says Margaret.

One of her challenges is high cost of electricity, especially when it comes to pumping water. 

Also, she says farmers have no standard price for produce, what makes buyers take advantage of them. 

“I can sell my onions at Sh100 per kilo, and somebody else sells at Sh20. If we had a standard price, we will make good profit.”

Some of the diseases she grapples with are downy mildew, purple blotch and bulb rot and pests such as thrips and caterpillars. But there are pesticides in the market to curb them. 

When it is too hot, she waters the crops in the evening for 30 minutes. “Onions consume too much water during the first month after transplanting and in the second month. However, when they form bulbs, they require little,” she explains.

She keeps 70 chickens of Kenbro and Kienyeji varieties for meat and eggs.

“Last month I bought 100 chicks and sold 60 after a month at Sh400 each,” she says

She sells mature Kienyeji cockerels at Sh1,500 each and hens at Sh800. An egg goes for Sh20.

“Rabbits for me are for beauty. There’re those friends who I left in Nairobi, they request for farm visits. Even parents of children where I used to teach request to visit. This is a farm, a home, and also a resource centre. I started with three, they are now eight. I had five cows, all of them calved down last year, so they are now 10.”

She milks over 70 litres per day and sells to a cooperative society in Kiserian at Sh40 a litre.

“In the morning, I supply 40-45 litres. At noon I supply 25 litres, and in the evening I don’t supply,” says the farmer.

She has advice to aspiring farmers: “You only need water, determination and hope. Many people ask me why I quit teaching. It is a personal decision. Go for your goals,” says Margaret.

Her plan is to venture into value addition. “I am thinking of what I can do to my onions to increase the shelf-life. I can also use my tomatoes to make paste or sauce for more Money.”

Carol Mutua, a crop production specialist from Egerton University, says for higher  yields and best quality bulbs, onions should be grown in areas with altitude of 1,000m above sea level, although reasonable harvest may be realised at lower altitudes.

“Bulbs form at relatively high temperatures. Tropical temperatures are sufficient to induce bulbing even at high altitudes. Vegetative growth best occurs at 18-250C. At temperatures less than 150C, bulbs do not form. At temperatures above 250C, bulbs assume maturity before they reach economic size resulting in low yields.“

extensive agriculture,  in agricultural economics, system of crop cultivation using small amounts of labour and capital in relation to area of land being farmed. The crop yield in extensive agriculture depends primarily on the natural fertility of the soil, the terrain, the climate, and the availability of water.

Extensive agriculture is distinguished from intensive agriculture in that the latter, employing large amounts of labour and capital, enables one to apply fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides and to plant, cultivate, and often harvest mechanically. Because extensive agriculture produces a lower yield per unit of land, its use commercially requires large quantities of land in order to be profitable. This demand for land means that extensive agriculture must be carried on where land values are low in relation to labour and capital, which in turn means that extensive agriculture is practiced where population densities are low and thus usually at some distance from primary markets. Compare intensive agriculture."

We have prepared you a full guide to dairy farming this is to answer all the questions you need to know and of course to start, scale and develop your dairy farming, Before venturing into dairy farming you probably have asked yourself some of these questions (Remember that this guide has been tailored to answer all the questions stated and bonus tips which are clearly researched and proven to be effective in dairy farming

What is dairy farming? This is a type of agriculture that is focused on producing milk. This is different from raising animals to produce meat. Milk can be used to produce dairy products, including cheese. Species commonly used are cows (so-called dairy cows), but goats, sheep and camels are also used. In this guide we shall look into dairy farming in cows this is because it is the most kept animal for dairy.

HOW CAN I START DAIRY FARMING

This is always the first question that comes to mind when you have decided to venture in this dairy farming field. The first step here is doing thorough and extensive research. This is not because dairy farming is a very difficult venture but it is a step in ensuring that you gain the basic knowledge to get you started.

We all know that dairy farming as a business has a very high potential and is a high rapid growing venture in Africa and beyond. In Africa, Dairy farming has been a way of life and has been a means of livelihood and nutritional value. So the talking points here is to conduct in-depth market research to determine the current trends and feasibility study. This can be assisted by attending seminars, reading dairy magazines and also there are a lot of helpful articles online

Before venturing on Dairy farming here are the Key strengths you should look into

Key weaknesses on Dairy farming

HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO START A DAIRY FARM

This will be answered regarding your type of dairy whether large scale commercial, small scale commercial or domestic will attract different amount of money to start. Dairy farming can be a lucrative and rewarding business nowadays, but determining the amount of capital required to start a dairy farm can be a difficult and intimidating task. To calculate the cost of starting a dairy farm, document some basic information on a spreadsheet. Start by following some common steps.

These guidelines above will go a long way in getting you started.

WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE STARTING A DAIRY FARM

We outlined you the basic needs you should consider before starting a dairy farm in the list below;

HOW MANY COWS DO I NEED TO START A DAIRY FARM

It is important to put into consideration that starting small and scaling your farm upwards later is effective. One or two cows may be too few and over six cows may be too many for most beginners. Five to six cows have always been a good number which then can be progressively increased as you build and improve the herd. Remember to always keep in mind the initial cost of each cow you intend to keep in your farm

cultivation,  in agriculture and horticulture, the loosening and breaking up (tilling) of the soil or, more generally, the raising of crops. The soil around existing plants is cultivated—by hand using a hoe or by machine using a cultivator—to destroy weeds and promote growth by increasing soil aeration and water infiltration. Soil being prepared for the planting of a crop is cultivated by a harrow or plow. Numerous systems have been developed for the cultivation of crops in the long history of agriculture, including terrace cultivation, agroforestry, crop rotation, shifting agriculture, and others.

crop rotation,   the successive cultivation of different crops in a specified order on the same fields, in contrast to a one-crop system or to haphazard crop successions.

Throughout human history, wherever food crops have been produced, some kind of rotation cropping appears to have been practiced. One system in central Africa employs a 36-year rotation; a single crop of finger millet is produced after a 35-year growth of woody shrubs and trees has been cut and burned. In the major food-producing regions of the world, various rotations of much shorter length are widely used. Some of them are designed for the highest immediate returns, without much regard for the continuing usefulness of the basic resources. Others are planned for high continuing returns with protected resources. The underlying principles for planning effective cropping systems began to emerge in the middle years of the 19th century.

Early experiments, such as those at the Rothamsted experimental station in England in the mid-19th century, pointed to the usefulness of selecting rotation crops from three classifications: cultivated row, close-growing grains, and sod-forming, or rest, crops. Such a classification provides a ratio basis for balancing crops in the interest of continuing soil protection and production economy. It is sufficiently flexible for adjusting crops to many situations, for making changes when needed, and for including go-between crops as cover and green manures.

A simple rotation would be one crop from each group with a 1:1:1 ratio. The first number in a rotation ratio refers to cultivated row crops, the second to close-growing grains, and the third to sod-forming, or rest, crops. Such a ratio signifies the need for three fields and three years to produce each crop annually. This requirement would be satisfied with a rotation of corn, oats, and clover or of potatoes, wheat, and clover-timothy. Rotations for any number of fields and crop relationships can be described in this manner. In general, most rotations are confined to time limits of eight years or less.

The acreage devoted to sod-forming, or rest, crops should be expanded at the expense of row crops on soils of increasing slopes and declining fertility. This will provide better vegetative covering to protect sloping land from excessive erosion and supply organic matter for improving soil productivity on both sloping and level lands. With lessening slope and increasing fertility, the row crops may be expanded, but this should not be done with too much reduction in the sod-forming crops. The differing effects of crops on soils and on each other and in reactions to insect pests, diseases, and weeds require carefully planned sequences.

Broadly speaking, cropping systems should be planned around the use of deep-rooting legumes. If too little use is made of them, productivity will decline; if too much land is devoted to them, wastes may occur and other useful crops will be displaced. Rotations depending wholly on green-manure legumes should be confined to the more level and fertile lands. It is desirable to include legumes alone or in mixtures with nonlegume sod-forming crops as a regular crop in many field rotations. In general, this should occur about once in each four-year period. Short rotations are not likely to provide the best crop balances, and long rotations on a larger number of fields may introduce complications. With a moderate number of fields, additional flexibility can be provided by split cropping on some fields.

The usefulness of individual field crops is affected by regional differences in climate and soil. A major crop in one region may have little or no value in another. In each region, however, there are usually row, grain, and sod, or rest, crops that can be brought together into effective cropping systems.

In addition to the many beneficial effects on soils and crops, well-planned crop rotations also provide the business aspects of farming with advantages. Labour, power, and equipment can be handled with more efficiency; weather and market risks can be reduced; livestock requirements can be met more easily; and the farm can be a more effective year-round enterprise.

This is the full guide with all information on how to grow courgettes in Kenya. Whether you want to start courgettes farming or you are a courgette farmer this blog post will help you improve on your farming. Some of the main questions asked on courgette farming in Kenya include;

HOW TO GROW COURGETTES IN KENYA

Courgette or Zucchini is a green fleshy vegetable grown mainly for sale or for subsistence consumption. Some of the health benefits of courgette consumption include;

For more health benefits of zucchini visit the health line website

ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS OF COURGETTES

There are many varieties of courgettes grown in Kenya the main varieties of courgettes include Ambassador F1, Simba F1, Black beauty, Cera F1 and Green Zucchini, among others.

Courgettes are easy to grow and the climatic conditions include a temperature of 15-22 degrees Celsius, water supply of 800mm during the vegetative growth period. However irrigation can be used to supplement in areas with dry conditions, Zucchini requires an altitude of 500-2000m above sea level and a well-drained fertile soil.

PLANTING

Courgettes are always easy to plant and are grown from seeds. You can choose to plant on seed bed then transplant on 3-4 leaf stage

Seedlings are planted on a well ploughed and harrowed land free from weeds, organic fertilizers are preferred fertilizers.

On the land to be planted, Create mounds of about 10 inches high, up to 2 feet in diameter. The spacing between mounds should be about 4 feet apart. You can plant six seeds per mount. Ensure even spacing. Cover the seeds with loose soil.  

Courgettes does not tolerate humidity it is therefore important to transplant in full sun

Regular farm practices for courgette farm continue throughout the growth period these practices include;

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your courgettes. Weeds harm the proper growth of the courgettes

Mulching; the courgettes should be mulched to retain soil moisture and keep the fruits clean. When decomposed, the mulch releases nutrients into the soil which are absorbed by the courgettes

Watering/Irrigation; the courgette soil should be kept moderately moist throughout, and more when the plants are in flowering and fruiting stages.

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in courgettes making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

Some of the pests and diseases affecting courgettes farming include

Be it you want to start commercial chili farming or chili farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into chili farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW CHILI IN KENYA

PLANTING

Chili is grown in Kenya to be used as a spice and ingredient. Before planting of chili these are some of their ecological conditions, chili requires medium rainfall because excessive rainfall can cause leaf shedding and minimum rainfall causes stunted growth, Chili are sensitive to frost hence require warm temperatures the optimum temperature for  growth of chili fruits are 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. Chili should also be grown in light loamy, non-acidic well-draining soil.

SEEDLINGS PREPARATION

Chili are always grown from seedlings where they are raised in nursery then transplanted to the main field. To prepare your seedlings in the nursery  make raised beds of soil 1m wide and the length of your convenience, mix the soil with farmyard manure then make uniform furrow drills across the bed. The furrows should be 10 cm apart, now sow seeds on the furrows and cover with light soil. To protect the seedlings on the nursery bed, mulch the nursery bed. Continuous care of the nursery by weeding and watering continues until the seedlings are ready to be transplanted this is when they are 8 to 10cm tall and with at least 4 true leaves. You should also consider thinning of the seedlings.

SEED RATE FOR CHILI

The approximate seed rate for chili peppers is about 400 to 500grams of seeds per hectare depending on spacing

When your chili seedlings are ready now it’s ready for transplanting land to be transplanted to should be properly ploughed and harrowed free from weeds. Always remember to transplant your seedlings in the evening and directly after it is uprooted from the nursery bed. On the actual land make holes with spacing of 40cm within rows and 50 cm between rows. You may choose to intercrop to save on land and supplement your income.

FERTILIZER APPLICATION

The rate for fertilizer application for chili is 10tons per ha of farm yard manure or compost or 2 handfuls per planting holes. You may also choose to apply 250kgs per ha of DAP during transplanting. CAN of 100kg per ha can be used for topdressing when the chili are 15cm tall

Regular farm practices for chili farm continues as you wait for maturity

Soil conditioning: This is done by application of manure to the soil this is done in moderation too much nutrients or too little nutrients may damage your chili plantation

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your potatoes. Weeds harm the proper growth of the chili plantation

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in chili making it necessary for integration of pest management practices pest affecting chili in Kenya include aphids, mites, thrips and white flies. Diseases for chili include; Anthracnose, bacterial wilt, Late blight, downey, Mildew and Rust

HARVESYTING OF CHILI

Chili fruits are ready for first picking between 3 months after transplanting Picking continues for about 4 months. It is always recommended to pick the red ripe chilies first as soon as they appear chilies should also be picked without stalks. Consider also not to take the damaged, overripe green chilies to the dryer

MARKETTING OF CHILLI IN KENYA

Chili farming has proved to be a very profitable venture in Kenya, Chili is exported to countries like France, United Kingdom, Spain and Germany, chili is also sold locally in markets supermarkets and various institutions Chili storage is in sacks or crates. Depending on management, an acre of chili can produce up to 1000 to 3000kgs 1kg of chili can cost up to 50 to 70 shillings which varies according to time and availability. This should proof how profitable is chili farming in Kenya.

HOW TO GROW CARROTS IN KENYA

PLANTING

Carrot is a tuber crop grown in Kenya mainly for commercial and domestic consuming, it is mostly used as a spice to prepare almost every meal. The main varieties of carrots grown in Kenya include, Samba, Sunrise F1, Nantes, Chanteny, Amsterdam,Minicolor, Super koruda, Napolitana F1. We shall skip directly to its ecological requirements. Carrots does well in areas of 700mm above sea level, rainfall of 450-600mm during the growing period, Well drained, deep, fertile sandy loam or clay loam with pH 5.5-7.0 and a temperature of 15-22 degrees Celsius.

Carrots are planted by direct seeding, or grown on nursery beds directly. The land where carrots are to be planted should be ploughed deeply and perennial weeds removed completely, the seedbed should be harrowed to a fine tilt. We recommend the planting of carrots directly on the farm rather than transplanting.

Make furrows of 15cm apart and 2cm deep you can combine seeds with light soil before sowing, farmyard or compost manure can be used when growing carrots. You are supposed to leave 2 to 4cm between seedlings so thinning immediately after germination should be done. This spacing encourages the growth of strong mature carrots roots.

Regular farm practices for carrots farm continues

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your carrots. Weeds harm the proper growth of the carrots

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in carrots making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

HOW TO START CABBAGE FARMING IN KENYA

PLANTING

Seeds are bought from your nearest Agro dealer ensure that you choose the best seeds as this is the main factor in the value of cabbage production. Prepare a good nursery bed with fine soil and you can also mix farmyard manure to the soil. Plant seeds on the nursery on even furrow-like lines. Normal caring of the nursery bed by irrigation and weeding up to 4 to 6 weeks when the cabbage seedlings can be transplanted continues. This is when the cabbage seedlings have attained true leaves and has a height of 3 inches tall.

The land to be transplanted to should be ploughed and harrowed properly to be made free from weeds and hardpans. Cabbage requires well-draining soil and enough sunlight areas. Make furrow ridges on the land and ensure spacing between the seeds because cabbages can grow up to 6 kilograms per head.

Add farmyard manure or organic manure to the ridges and cover the seedlings firmly with soil.

The rows should be well spaced and on even lines. Regular irrigation when there is less or minimum rainfall continues wedding also continues to allow the cabbages to grow and mature.

Cabbage spacing

Spacing of the transplanted seedlings should be 18 inches on furrows or between holes dug and 2 feet between rows. This will enable proper growth and handling of your cabbage vegetables.

Beekeeping farming is a profitable business in South Africa. The most important thing that new beekeepers will need when starting Bee farming in South Africa is knowledge. You will need to understand the specific techniques for managing bees, the structure of the hive, the function of the bee, its body and how it feeds, its favorite foods, predators, and diseases. Managing bees in South Africa is difficult and complex, but there are various market opportunities for Beekeeping.

In South Africa, honey is a sweet juice produced by bees and used for human consumption. South Africa produces about 2000 tons of honey every year. However, the demand for honey in South Africa is about 3000 tons per year. South Africa imports honey from other countries to meet local demand. It clearly shows an opportunity for more beekeepers in the beekeeping business in South Africa. The bee farming business in South Africa is also very profitable due to high market prices and high demand for honey.

If you want to start Beekeeping in South Africa, new beekeepers will need space to keep a swarm (or bee colony), a hive, and a place to put the hive close enough to bee food sources. (A good source of fodder and water will produce the best honey). You will also need protective clothing and some tools to work with the hive and colony. The South African Bee Industry Organization (SABIO) distinguishes between hobby beekeepers (with one to 100 bees) and commercial beekeepers who manage 800 to 10,000 bees.

Smallholders or developing beekeepers may have 10 to 150 beehives. They are often placed in cooperative bodies or as community development projects and are managed. South Africa is home to two subspecies or breeds of bees native to the country: Apis mellifera scutellata (or “African honey bee“) and Apis mellifera capensis (or “cape honey bee”). The African honey bee belongs to Central and Southern Africa. 

Commercial beekeepers on their own are unable to provide all the necessary funding and infrastructure to support and sustain the bee population in South Africa. The importance of bees to agriculture and conservation in South Africa far outweighs the value derived from beekeepers. Therefore, commercial beekeepers cannot provide all the necessary funding and infrastructure to support and sustain the bee population in South Africa. 

In case you missed it: Honey Bee Farming Project Report, Cost, Profits

The cooperation of all those who get a price from bees, including the government, will also be required. Beekeepers manage south African bees to harvest honey and provide crop pollen. Organized bees are essential for food production in South Africa. Some policies can help secure fodder for bees and support South Africa’s beekeeping industry. 

If you live in a town, ask the municipality if it is allowed to keep bees in the suburbs. Keep the hive at least 50 meters away from animals and people. Keep hives away from chickens and horses in rural areas; bees do not like the smell of these animals. The place where bees are kept is an apiary, and it needs accessible shelter, dry and sunny, but with no risk of frostbite. Also, it needs to be able to provide food and water for bees that are no more than 3-5 km from the hive. 

Although there may be enough food for a few colonies (swarms) in some areas, it may not be able to accompany it all season. Therefore, it may be necessary to move the colonies to suitable crops when they are in flower. It can be a valuable pollination service for beekeepers with an additional honey bonus for farmers. Before installing a hive, always seek permission from the property owner. The South African Bee Industry Organization (SABIO) represents beekeepers in South Africa and advises all beekeepers to register their hives. 

Beehives are essential when conducting beekeeping business in South Africa. Beehives are home to bees, where bees live and produce honey. Many bees are available, including Langstroth hive, Frame hive, Fixed comb hive, Kenya top bar hive, and Top bar hive. Good beehive features include the right size, locally available, dry, affordable, and protected from pests and predators.

The beehive type is important as it affects the amount of honey you can expect to be harvested. Thus, the type and size of the honeycomb affect the expected honey production. Other tools needed for the bee farming business include bee brushes, smokers, feeders, and hive tools. Protective clothing is also essential. 

In case you missed it: Honey Bee Farming Information Guide

Honey processing equipment is required depending on the bee farming operation size. These include honey extractors, storage containers, and wax melter. The beekeeping business plan should cover the cost of procuring beehives and equipment.

The main mission of SABIO is to represent the bee industry in South Africa and then promote this and all its aspects of establishing, supporting, and developing a sustainable and prosperous bee industry in the country. SABIO has so far been relatively unsuccessful in complying with the Agricultural Pests Act to register beekeepers. Beekeepers’ financial support for SABIO through existing voluntary membership fees and voluntary revenues (based on producer and hive number) has also been poor so far.

It has made it very difficult for SABIO to operate effectively as a South African beekeeping industry-government agency. SABIO will only be effective if it has all the role players as members. The industry’s role is likely to decline as the needs of large commercial operations cannot be considered relevant to the hobby. 

However, all beekeepers must cooperate through the same body represented by SABIO, as the basic requirements for disease control, food safety, and research apply to all serious beekeepers. There are whatever their production capacity. The main beekeeping associations, namely:

To start a honey bee business in South Africa, you need bee colonies. These are the bees that will produce honey. Bees live in colonies, and each colony may have 80,000 bees. There are three different types of bees in the bee colony: Queen Bee, Worker Bee, and Drone Bee. The queen bee’s main purpose is to mate and lay eggs. 

She mates with the drone bees and produces eggs. It leads to an increase in the number of bees in the reproductive colony. The other type of bee found in the colony is the drone. The number of drone bees in the colony is usually in the hundreds, and the last type of bee in the colony is the worker bee. Worker bees are imperfect substances that cannot mate and reproduce. They are responsible for collecting nectar and pollen they use to make honey. 

Other duties of worker bees include: feeding other bees, raising the queen, cleaning the hive, removing dead bees, producing wax, and defending the hive. Though the worker bees make up the majority of bees in the colony, their numbers can be as high as 80,000. Your bee business plan should include the cost of acquiring bee colonies.

Requirements for keeping bees 

1. No one may keep bees anywhere unless – the person holding a permit that allows this activity and every hive of bees is located 

The bees are housed in an approved hive of bees. and beehives – 

No one may put or collect any garbage, manure, grass cuttings, or manure within five meters of the beehive. Beekeepers need to be registered with SABIO, the organization of the beekeeping industry in South Africa.

If you want to start Beekeeping in the Johannesburg metropolitan area, you need to be familiar with the bylaws of the metro. These are bee laws designed to keep people safe and provide guidelines for all beekeeping sites. However, beekeeping regulations are not well enforced if the public has an accident or injury and you do not have a beekeeper’s license as a beekeeper. If you have followed the rules of Beekeeping, you will face regulatory punishments. 

Healthy bees in an area with abundant nectar sources can earn a profit of $ 300- $ 500 per hive each year. But it assumes that you are selling your honey in a market willing to pay the price of premium raw honey. Even small-scale beekeepers in the backyard can profit from honey produced from a few hives. 

Pollination services have the greatest potential in the beekeeping industry in South Africa. In SA, the cost of pollination services for the fruit, vegetable, seed, and oil crops, and the nut industry, far exceeds the income from honey production and bee products in South Africa. The growth of the macadamia nut and blueberry industry has great potential for beekeepers who can provide pollination services for these edible crops. 

Macadamia nuts are planted in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa. The honey market needs to grow and can be expanded by producing honey with medicinal properties.

In case you missed it: How to Start Beekeeping in Australia: For Beginners, Courses, Rules, and Regulations

Short beekeeping courses can cost approximately R950 and R2,950. According to Bee equipment South Africa, you need about R3,340 to start a beekeeping business. It includes clothes, tools, and a beehive. 

These backyards come in many shapes and sizes. Some are several acres, and others are a few hundred square feet. Although bees can live in various environments, not every backyard is an excellent place to have a colony. Here’s a rule of thumb when you consider having a beehive;

A typical beehive is approximately 22 inches x 16 inches. You need 5 feet of space in each direction around the hive. If you plan to have more than one honeycomb, they should be at least three feet apart. 

The honey bee population worldwide is exposed to pests, parasites, pesticides, land use, climate change, and other stressors. These factors, and some home-bred beetles, such as the cappuccino social parasite, play a role in the health of South Africa’s bee population and all possible adverse effects on South Africa’s beekeeping industry. These various threats also threaten the agricultural sector and biodiversity, as both depend on pollination services.

 Because beekeepers keep only a small portion of the bee population in South Africa, and beekeepers “refill” their stocks by catching sheep, the wild population constitutes an essential resource that must be used sustainably. Beekeepers need to recognize the various bee pests and diseases. Early detection of any problem can lead to immediate action and thus prevent severe outbreaks and the resulting economic losses.

Demand for honey in South Africa is very high, about 3000 tons per year. Honey is a sweet, sticky juice used for human consumption throughout South Africa. You can deliver your honey to individuals, supermarkets, restaurants, and organizations. Honey is also used in medicine and cosmetics. Another by-product of bee farming is beeswax, which is used to polish shoes and make candles. Your bee farming business plan should include an appropriate marketing strategy.

In case you missed it: Earning 2 to 3 Lakhs from Mixed Farming: A Success Story of a Farmer in India

The average beekeeper’s salary is ZAR 228,916 a year and ZAR 110 per hour in South Africa. The average salary of a beekeeper is between ZAR 171,231 and ZAR 280,688. 

If you have permission, it is permissible to keep bees in the Johannesburg metropolitan area. Below is a copy of the Johannesburg Metro bylaws relating to Beekeeping. If you plan to raise bees this way, it is recommended that you attend a beginner course on Beekeeping. 

Each hive is approximately 2.5 square feet and should have a radius of at least five feet around it. Most beekeepers have one to four hives. Remember, bees are not set and forgotten. They require work to maintain. 

Many experienced beekeepers suggest that the entrance to the hive should face south or east. The Southern Exhibition is significant. 

With an average production of 15 kg of honey per year, 105 442 hives could produce 1580 tons of honey per year. Using the average retail price of honey of R40 / kg, the potential cost of producing honey from gum orchards in South Africa is R63. 2 million annually. 

The average age of a queen is three to four years. Drones usually die during mating or are removed from the hive before winter. And workers can survive a few weeks in the summer and several months in the extended areas in the winter.

A typical beehive is approximately 22 inches x 16 inches. You need 5 feet of space in each direction around the hive. If you plan to have more than one honeycomb, they should be at least three feet apart. 

The honey bee population worldwide is exposed to pests, parasites, pesticides, land use, climate change, and other stressors. These factors, and some home-bred beetles, such as the cappuccino social parasite, play a role in the health of South Africa’s bee population and all possible adverse effects on South Africa’s beekeeping industry. These various threats also threaten the agricultural sector and biodiversity, as both depend on pollination services.

 Because beekeepers keep only a small portion of the bee population in South Africa, and beekeepers “refill” their stocks by catching sheep, the wild population constitutes an essential resource that must be used sustainably. Beekeepers need to recognize the various bee pests and diseases. Early detection of any problem can lead to immediate action and thus prevent severe outbreaks and the resulting economic losses.

Demand for honey in South Africa is very high, about 3000 tons per year. Honey is a sweet, sticky juice used for human consumption throughout South Africa. You can deliver your honey to individuals, supermarkets, restaurants, and organizations. Honey is also used in medicine and cosmetics. Another by-product of bee farming is beeswax, which is used to polish shoes and make candles. Your bee farming business plan should include an appropriate marketing strategy.

The average beekeeper’s salary is ZAR 228,916 a year and ZAR 110 per hour in South Africa. The average salary of a beekeeper is between ZAR 171,231 and ZAR 280,688. 

If you have permission, it is permissible to keep bees in the Johannesburg metropolitan area. Below is a copy of the Johannesburg Metro bylaws relating to Beekeeping. If you plan to raise bees this way, it is recommended that you attend a beginner course on Beekeeping. 

Each hive is approximately 2.5 square feet and should have a radius of at least five feet around it. Most beekeepers have one to four hives. Remember, bees are not set and forgotten. They require work to maintain. 

Many experienced beekeepers suggest that the entrance to the hive should face south or east. The Southern Exhibition is significant. 

With an average production of 15 kg of honey per year, 105 442 hives could produce 1580 tons of honey per year. Using the average retail price of honey of R40 / kg, the potential cost of producing honey from gum orchards in South Africa is R63. 2 million annually. 

The average age of a queen is three to four years. Drones usually die during mating or are removed from the hive before winter. And workers can survive a few weeks in the summer and several months in the extended areas in the winter.

This is the definitive beans farming in Kenya complete guide with all information and answers to guide you on beans farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial beans farming or beans farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into beans farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide; beans farming in Kenya the complete guide

HOW TO GROW BEANS IN KENYA

PLANTING

Bean is one of the most important legume in the world and can be eaten in various ways whether cooked, fried or baked. Beans are planted for numerous reasons because of its nutritional and economical value. We shall proceed to discuss the full planting process here

Beans requires soil variety which is well drained and fertile, mostly soil rich in organic matter. Bean plants also tend to grow and mature faster in low altitude zones. A well distributed rainfall is required for the proper growth of beans although seasons should be well selected to avoid excessive rainfall during flowering period. Moderate temperature is required for the proper growth of beans and frost to be avoided

Beans plants are propagated using their seeds on a well harrowed land free from weeds and hardpans. The best seed selection is very crucial to avoid low quality yields avoid damaged, wrinkled and diseased seeds

BEANS SPACING

When your land is properly harrowed and you should consider at the onset of rainfall, dig small holes on the land in a uniform row to a depth of 1 to 2 inches and 30 to 15 cm between holes. Also consider 50cm between rows for ease of management Place one to two seeds in each hole and add farmyard or DAP fertilizer. Cover with soil lightly. Do the same when intercropping with maize plantation

Beans are one of the plants with very low maintenance cost during growth but you may continue with the normal farm practices to monitor and maximize your bean production

FARM PRACTICES FOR BEANS

Soil conditioning: This is done by application of manure or CAN to the soil this is done in moderation too much nutrients or too little nutrients may damage your beans plantation

Weeding: this is the removal of unwanted plants on the area where you may have grown your beans. Weeds harm the proper growth of the beans

Monitoring: this is done by frequently checking for pest and diseases. Some pests may invest in beans making it necessary for integration of pest management practices

By following this practices within a matter of weeks your beans should be growing vigorously and rapidly you will even notice flowering.

HARVESTING OF BEANS

Within a period of 80 to 120 days depending of the beans variety or ecological conditions your beans will have turned yellow and now ready for harvesting. To notice full maturity of beans you notice the yellowish or brownish color and even seeds dropping.

You can now harvest your beans when green or when dry, before storage be sure to dry the beans on the sun to remove moisture. The beans plantation are normally harvested by uprooting the whole plants and dried on the sun for one to two weeks where they can be placed on sacks and grounded to expose the beans from the pods. The pods can later be used as feeds or to create farmyard manure

Beans are stored on sacks and kept for storage after application of insecticides or taken directly to the market.

MARKETTING OF BEANS

After successfully harvesting your beans you are now ready for marketing after storage in sacks. Beans are sold in kilograms to various market around Kenya or in debes for small scale traders.

An acre of bean plantation can produce up to 20 bags of beans 90 kg each in 90 days and 1 bag can cost up to 6500kshs shillings which varies according to time and availability and bean variety. This should proof how profitable is bean farming in Kenya.

There is always ready market for your beans in Kenya you can market beans in schools and institutions, fast food chains, hotels and open air markets.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON BEANS FARMING IN KENYA

Beans farming in Kenya is done in almost all parts of the country However, Eastern, Nyanza, Central, Western and Rift valley are the major bean growing provinces.

An acre of bean plantation can produce up to 20 bags of beans 90 kg each in 90 days and 1 bag can cost up to 6500kshs shillings which varies according to time and availability and bean variety. This should proof how profitable is bean farming in Kenya.

PESTS: bean fly, cutworms, aphids, leaf miners, pod borers, whiteflies and thrips

DISEASES: Bean rust, downy mildew, anthracnose, Bacterial wilt, Fusarium wilt

I recommend the use of organic farmyard manure as it is cheaply available however DAP fertilizer should be applied at the rate of 1/2 bag/acre (25 kg/acre) during planting. The fertilizer should be thoroughly mixed with soil before covering the seed

Within a period of 80 to 120 days depending of the beans variety or ecological conditions your beans will have turned yellow and now ready for harvesting. To notice full maturity of beans you notice the yellowish or brownish color and even seeds dropping

To maximize the bean production, you require to plant 50 kilos of beans seed for 1 acre.

This is the profitable banana farming in Kenya definitive guide with all information and answers to guide you on banana farming in Kenya. Be it you want to start commercial banana farming or banana farming for domestic purpose this guide is prepared specifically for you. Before venturing into banana farming in Kenya there are some of the questions you have been asking yourself we intend to answer all of these questions on this guide;

HOW TO GROW BANANAS IN KENYA

PLANTING

Bananas are grown in Kenya from many varieties the varieties of bananas grown in Kenya include;

Ripening varieties: Gross Michel, Apple, Giant Cavandish, Dwarf Cavandish, Williams hybrid, Grand Nain, Vallery, paz, lacatan, Ugandan red, peripeta

Cooking Varieties: Ng’ombe, Ugandan green, Mutahato, GradiShisikame

The suitable ecological conditions for growing bananas in Kenya include altitude of 1800m sea level, warm humid climate, and average temperature of 20-30 degrees Celsius, annual rainfall of between 1000 and 2500 mm

Bananas are planted from seedlings and tissue culture seedlings have been proven to be high quality free from diseases one seedling can cost from 100kshs to 150 kshs

Before planting ensure the area to be planted to is properly cultivated and harrowed and area free from trees or buildings

Plant your bananas on onset of rain to the main field, Under dry conditions dig holes 90cm by 90cm by 60cm, in wet areas dig the holes 60cm by 60cm by 60cm.

Spacing is done depending on variety but mostly make spacing of 3.0m × 4.0m this will result to approximately 450 plantlets per acre. Soil can be mixed with well decomposed manure or DAP fertilizer 40-60kg of decomposed farmyard manure is applied per stool per year before the rains. This is applied on the outer diameter of the canopy. A short-forked hoe is used to incorporate the manure shallowly and carefully, to ensure no root damage. 250-300g of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) should be distributed around each stool per year, together with 125g of TSP, which is worked into the soil.

To provide bigger and higher quality bunches, bananas have to be de-suckered regularly to control any unwanted sucker growth. Only three pseudo-stems should be allowed to remain on each corm: one bearing one half grown, and one just sprouting.

IRRIGATION can also be done to banana plantation in areas with minimal rainfall, yellow leaves should also be removed regularly to allow other leaves to grow remember that to improve on your income you can intercrop bananas with other crops

HARVESTING OF BANANAS

The time for maturity of a bananas depends on area and variety of the bananas planted. A banana plant takes roughly 8 to 12 months to mature. Maturity indices vary widely among varieties. Angularities or fullness of fingers, as well as color change are some of the standard criteria used. Immature bananas are very angular but fill out to a rounded shape at full maturity. Fruits are ready for harvesting 90 – 150 days after fingers start to form. A stem of banana can produce a bunch which weighs 95kgs. Harvesting is done carefully to avoid falling and bruising. You can store the banana on a cold room immediately after harvesting

The average yield is 35 to 45 tons per acre under good management. The economic lifespan of a banana plantation is 8 to 10 years, after which productivity declines. This should proof how profitable is banana farming in Kenya

BANANA MARKET IN KENYA

Meru County is the largest producer of bananas in Kenya, bananas can be exported to international markets or sold locally in markets, supermarkets and institutions.

Other main areas where bananas are grown largescale in Kenya include; Kisii, Nyamira, Embu, Tharaka nithi, Kirinyaga and many other areas

BANANA PESTS AND DISEASES

There are some of the pests and diseases affecting bananas the diseases include; anthracnose, banana speckle, Cordana leaf spot, fusarium wilt,Rhizome rot and Yellow sigatoka

9,Agriculture,"Victor Mwamuye on his azolla farm in Kilifi County. 


By 
Dr Joseph Mugachia


Veterinary doctor.



It looks like the story on azolla will not just fade away. This tells us livestock farmers are identifying with the plant’s potential as a cheap source of protein for animal feeds.

This is not surprising because protein is the most expensive component of animal feeds and also the most difficult to obtain.

Soybean is the most common source of protein for animal feeds around the world. The US produces the crop on a very large scale to supply its huge livestock production industry. Kenya grows very little soybean. Most of our supplies come from Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia.

The high cost of transport from these countries and the competition with other export markets makes the product very expensive to Kenyan feed manufacturers.

The high feed manufacturing price inevitably translates to very costly feeds, making livestock production unprofitable especially to the small-scale farmers.

Last week, I discussed the availability of azolla starter stock and how to establish the plant. Many readers have asked me whether there is data on the suitability of azolla as an animal feed.

Yes, the data is available for different species of animals. You may recall the plant is suitable as a feed for all species of livestock. In fact, there are ongoing studies to determine if the fern is suitable for human consumption.

From my knowledge of comparative digestion and animal bio-chemistry, I can bet the plant would be okay as human food. You see, none of the species of animals in which the plant has been tested has shown any adverse effects. Further, all the animals have shown beneficial outcomes when fed with azolla.

Two good indicators of possible suitability as human food are the pigs and fish. Pigs have a digestive system very close to the human one while fish are highly sensitive to poisons. However, no product is used in humans without being tested because despite similarities of humans and other animals, there are still some differences that could render a product unfit for human use.

To answer those farmers and readers who wanted to know if there is scientific data on the suitability of azolla as an animal feed substitute and supplement, I reviewed some publications on research done on the subject.

First, I pronounce a disclaimer that azolla cannot substitute other animal feed protein ingredients like soybean, sunflower and cottonseed cake. It is a supplement for these protein sources. This is because there is no one ingredient with all the required proteins and minerals.

Azolla is very rich in proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin B12 and Beta carotene), growth promoter compounds and minerals. It has high levels of calcium, phosphorous, potassium, iron, copper and magnesium. The carbohydrates and fat content is low. The plant is highly digestible because it does not accumulate secondary plant materials such as the woody lignin.

Read:  Farmers cash in on alternative livestock feeds

Researchers led by Becerra in 1995, Lumpkin and Plucknett in 1982 and Van Hove and López in 1983 all concluded that azolla is the most-promising aquatic plant for livestock feed due to its ease of cultivation, productivity and nutritive value. Azolla’s use as a feed for fish, swine and poultry was tested and recommended by Alcantara and Querubin in 1985. Tran and Dao in 1979 reported that one hectare of azolla can produce 540-720kg of protein per month.

Poultry, particularly ducks and chickens, can be raised on a diet including fresh azolla. In 1966, Dao and Tran confirmed that azolla has long been recognised as a feed for wildfowl in the US, domesticated ducks in China and domestic fowl in Vietnam.

In 1978 in India, Subudhi and Singh concluded that fresh azolla could replace about 20 per cent of commercial feed in the diet of young chickens. They estimated that around 9kg of fresh azolla would be required daily for 100 chickens to make the replacement.

That amount could be produced in a shallow pond with an area of 60 square metres.

Some feeding trials have shown that 20–25 per cent of commercial chicken feeds could be replaced by supplementing it with fresh azolla. Birds with 75 per cent of the regular feed and 12.5 per cent azolla had an almost equal weight to birds with 100 per cent regular feed.

Furthermore, birds that received normal feed with 5 per cent extra in the form of azolla grew faster than the birds with 100 per cent f­eed alone. They also had a 10–12 per cent increase in the total body weight. The number of eggs laid and their quality was also higher in the azolla-fed birds.

Indian researchers led by Kamalasanana in 2002 found an increase in milk yield when azolla was combined with regular feed. They replaced 15-20 per cent of commercial feed with the same quantity of azolla on dry weight basis. This led to a 20-25 per cent saving on buying commercial feeds. Milk yield increased by between 10 and 15 per cent and went up to 20 per cent in the dry summer months.

The researchers noted that the increase in milk yield was higher than the quantity of azolla fed. They concluded there was need for more research to understand why azolla feeding caused an unexpected high increase in milk yield.

There is a lot of evidence on the benefits of azolla farming. However, farmers taking it up should be aware that water quality and availability are the most limiting challenges of its production.

This is the avocado farming in Kenya comprehensive guide with all the details you need to know in starting and growing your avocado farm in Kenya. First and foremost before we step in to the details there are some quick facts you should know about avocado farming in Kenya

In this avocado farming in Kenya comprehensive guide we intend to answer all your questions regarding avocado farming. Some of the questions frequently asked include:

HOW TO GROW AVOCADOS

Avocado is a high protein and oil rich fruit native to America but grown in Kenya. It is usually grown for domestic purposes but mainly due to its demand it has become a commercial crop grown in Kenya. Avocados grows in almost every part in Kenya but we can take a snippet into the ecological conditions.

Avocados depending on its variety does well in areas of 0-2500 m above sea level, requires deep soil with good water holding capacity and good draining, moderate temperature and well distributed rainfall of 1600mm also dry and rainy conditions are perfectly suitable for avocados.

PLANTING

Planting of avocados is done by using their seedlings which should be chosen carefully. Grafted avocado seedlings are the best. The land or area to be planted should be well harrowed and free from weeds.

On the land where avocado seedlings are to be planted prepare holes of 60*, 60*, 60* cm, for the pure stand the standard spacing is 9m by 9m

Keep in mind that the general spacing for individual avocado plant should be 6m by 7m to 8m by 10m for ultimate production

Avocado holes should be well fed with farmyard, manure and DAP fertilizer. Mixed properly with the top soil. After mixing the fertilizer with soil ensure the soil is moist then you can now plant the seedlings on the holes. Cover the seedlings with soil up to the level they were at the nursery. Ensure bud union to be 300mm above the ground. If it’s not in the rainy season water the seedlings immediately after planting

FARM PRACTICES FOR AVOCADOES

Normal farm practices is applied and continues for the period of growth to maturity of avocado plantation the practices include;

1. Irrigation– Water is vital in several stages of tree development and the fruiting cycle. Use 5 to 20 liters of water frequently depending on the size of the seedling

2. Fertilization– Apply 1 wheelbarrow of well decomposed manure twice a year i.e. during the onset of long and short rains. Also, Top-dress with 120g of CAN. Lack of minerals will be seen in the leaves.

3. Pruning– Prune at early stages before flowering and upon completion of harvesting. This will encourage lateral growth and multiple framework branching. Ensure the tree canopy height is always maintained at 70% of its row width. This will allow light to penetrate, improve yield and provides a superior tree structure

4. Thinning– This involves removing some of the already formed fruits in order reduce competition for nutrients, therefore ensuring high-quality fruits. Too many fruits will result to small sized fruits.

5. Weeding– Weed to reduce competition for nutrients and water.

AVOCADO HARVESTING

Avocados in Kenya matures at the period of 7 to 10 months after flowering this varies according to variety and ecological conditions of the area. To determine maturity of the avocados is pot difficult  example the dark colored avocado variety mature when they start to turn from green to dark color, while green-colored varieties become smoother, may develop corky spots, and a yellow tint to skin and stem. Clippers are always used for harvesting and it is important to note that avocados do not ripen while on trees.

During harvesting avoid picking immature fruits as they will not ripen up. Avocados usually ripen at 3 to 4 weeks after picking depending on its variety.

Avocados should be handled with care as they are easily bruised. Storage should be done on crates or double layered boxes ready for shipment or marketing

AVOCADO MARKETTING IN KENYAKenya ranked 8th globally (2.1% of market share) in 2019 in export of avocados shipping out 59,000 tons with annual value of Kshs 10.6 Billion, behind Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Spain, Chile, Colombia and the United States. Among the top exporters, the fastest-growing avocados exporters since 2015 were: Colombia (up 1,607%), Dominican Republic (up 424.2%), Morocco (up 206.6%) and Kenya (up 161.5%). In 2020, up to end of October Kenya has exported 68,000 tons valued at Kshs. 14 Billion. Recently in April 2021 a report was released showing a whopping 4.6billion earnings by Kenya through avocados in only 3 months so, what are you waiting for?

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON AVOCADO FARMING IN KENYA

aquaculture, also called fish farming, fish culture, or mariculture,  the propagation and husbandry of aquatic plants, animals, and other organisms for commercial, recreational, and scientific purposes. Aquaculture is an approximate aquatic equivalent to agriculture—that is, the rearing of certain marine and freshwater organisms to supplement the natural supply. This includes production for supplying other aquaculture operations, for providing food and industrial products, for stocking sport fisheries, for supplying aquatic bait animals, for stocking fee-fishing operations, for providing aquatic organisms for ornamental purposes, and for supplying feedstocks to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. These activities can occur worldwide.

Aquaculture has been in existence since at least 500 bce. However, only since the mid-20th century has it assumed commercial importance. The rapid expansion of aquaculture has been to a large extent in the production of relatively high-priced species frequently consumed as a fresh product. Examples are shrimp, crayfish, prawns, trout, salmon, and oysters. However, also increasing is the production of catfish, carp, and tilapia, which are reared in extensive low-energy systems. For example, catfish farming in the United States has more than quintupled its production since it began to grow in the 1960s. Some of these freshwater fish are also utilized in aquaponics, a hybrid system that combines aquaculture with the hydroponic cultivation of plants; the fish wastes are used to feed the plants.

Ocean ranching by governments is intended to restock lakes and oceans. The young fish are bred in the controlled environment and when sufficiently mature are released into the open sea. Oysters (as a source of both food and pearls), scallops, and mussels are raised throughout most of the world. Carp, trout, catfish, and tilapia are also widely raised. Experiments with ocean ranching in the late 20th century led to the economically successful aquaculture of lobsters.

The growth of world aquaculture has been stimulated by a number of factors, including population increases, dietary shifts, and advances in aquaculture technology. Limits to the natural supply of ocean resources have also encouraged a growing role for aquaculture in helping to meet increasing demands for fish and shellfish.

Fish farming as originally practiced involved capturing immature specimens and then raising them under optimal conditions, in which they were well fed and protected from predators and competitors for light and space. It was not until 1733, however, that a German farmer successfully raised fish from eggs that he had artificially obtained and fertilized. Male and female trout were collected when ready for spawning. Eggs and sperm were pressed from their bodies and mixed together under favourable conditions. After the eggs hatched, the fish fry were taken to tanks or ponds for further cultivation. Methods have also been developed for artificial breeding of saltwater fish, and it now appears possible not only to rear sea animals but also to have the complete life cycle under hatchery control.

Farmed fish can be kept both in natural waters, such as in barricaded coastal waters or in cages suspended in open water, and in artificial aquatic impoundments, including earth ponds, tanks, or concrete pools. In these enclosures, the animals can be supplied with adequate food and protected from many natural predators. The most economically important species are carp, trout, salmon, and tilapia, which are discussed below. Many other fish are raised artificially by various methods. Among these are sturgeon, milkfish, mullet, striped bass, redfish, sea bass, and catfish.

Carp raising, practiced worldwide, is a good example of advanced techniques. For the whole life cycle at least three different types of ponds are used in Europe. Special shallow and warm ponds with rich vegetation provide a good environment for spawning, a process that today is often aided by hormone injections. After spawning, the parent fish are separated from the eggs and taken to a second pond. The fry, which hatch after a few days, are transported to shallow plankton-rich nursing ponds, where they remain until the fall of the year or the next spring. In tropical areas, such as India, carp spawned from wild fish can be collected by experts in natural waters. To collect eggs or fry from wild fish is disadvantageous, however, because the breeder cannot influence the breeding stocks in a desired direction. In Asia the fry of common or golden carp are thus generally bred under culture conditions in hatcheries. Bigger ponds are needed for rearing the fish in the second year of life. There are large carp ponds in certain areas of central Europe, while in Asia common carp are often cultivated in rice fields, a practice called wetland cultivation. This method is increasingly jeopardized by sprays used to control pests and diseases and by toxic agents resulting from industrial development.

For feeding carp in ponds, soybean meal, rice bran, and similar agricultural products are used. Concentrated food in the form of pellets has also been successfully introduced. During the winter season in the temperate zone, the carp are kept in deeper ponds with a dependable flow of water to protect them against freezing. In central Europe, carp are ready for market after the third summer. In southern Europe, Hungary, and parts of the Balkan Peninsula, carp may be sold after the second summer. In tropical areas the fish grow faster. To accelerate growth, warm-water ponds now exist in the temperate zone, where an average harvest of 400 to 500 kg per hectare is normal in intensive cultivation. By scientific management and careful selection, it is possible to obtain yields of up to 3,500 kg per hectare for carp in warm-water ponds.

The ornamental carp (koi) is a domesticated breed of the common carp. It is raised and bred similarly to carp raised for food.

Although trout was the first fish to be artificially fertilized, trout and salmon cultivation in Europe and North America is much younger than carp cultivation. Trout are cold-water fish and must have a constant supply of sufficient oxygen, making cultivation more difficult. Though trout ponds can be smaller than carp ponds, good year-round water circulation is essential. Trout farms are therefore often located in mountainous areas where plentiful pure water is available. The young fish are obtained exclusively by artificial fertilization; thus, hatchery buildings with low-temperature water and good filters are the centre of this type of pond fishery. There the eggs are kept under control during breeding in special small tanks. As soon as the hatched fry can swim and eat on their own, they are transplanted to rearing ponds for feeding.

Trout are carnivores; meatpacking by-products are used for feed. Such food may be released into the ponds at predetermined intervals by automatic dispensers. Though many authorities claim that trout should have as much natural foodstuff as possible and therefore should be raised in natural ponds only, in many countries rearing is done in concrete-lined ponds or concrete tanks, which are easy to keep clean and permit disinfectant application. The time necessary to rear fish and the yield per hectare depend on feeding. Trout are important sport fishes and are often raised in hatcheries for later transfer to habitable bodies of water. Some trout farms sell their fish not only fresh and frozen but also smoked and filleted.

For trout and salmon, a new system of fish cultivation has been introduced. Instead of ponds, enclosures of netting or other materials are placed in natural waters, such as lakes for trout, and also in brackish waters or the coastal ocean for salmon. By this means, areas formerly of low value can be farmed intensively. Salmon production occurs in three-year cycles. The first year is similar to that for young trout and occurs in controlled freshwater environments. The salmon are then transported to seawater cages for the rest of the cycle. Since the period preceding World War II, trout and salmon farming in seawater has grown tremendously. By the first quarter of the 21st century, about 60 percent of all salmon production worldwide was from farmed fish. Most commercial salmon farming occurs in Chile, Norway, Canada, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Ireland, and the Faroe Islands, in areas where the cold waters have a protective shoreline.

Although it is clearly productive and cost-efficient, farming fish such as salmon and trout in natural areas has a number environmental disadvantages. Like any form of animal agriculture, fish farming generates large amounts of concentrated waste, a form of water pollution. In natural environments without strong currents to help dissipate it, this waste accumulates and can harm marine life and trigger toxic algae blooms. The high density of fish housed together in pens can lead to fish lice infestations, which cause high mortality for the farmed animals and spread readily to wild fish. While some farmed fish are fed chicken and grain products, which has been criticized as unnatural for aquatic animals, others are fed products derived from wild-caught fish. Indeed, about 70 percent of the world’s fish meal and fish oil goes to fish farms, so the claim that fish farming reduces the strain on wild stocks is debatable. The farming of Atlantic salmon in the Pacific has been criticized as a potential risk to the various species of Pacific salmon should the exotic animals escape.

In 2021 a biotech company named AquaBounty harvested its first genetically modified salmon at an indoor aquaculture farm in Albany, Indiana. Such fish grow twice as fast as wild salmon, reaching market size in 18 months rather than 36, and are promoted as having a lower carbon footprint than traditionally farmed salmon. In addition to receiving the standard criticisms leveled at other GMO foods, genetically modified salmon have been denounced because, if they escaped pens in Pacific waters, they might breed and compete with wild salmon, which could harm indigenous communities that rely on wild salmon.

The use of tilapia in warm-water aquaculture systems dates back to early Egyptian civilization. The fish are perhaps best known because of their potential as an easily raised and harvested food fish. They can be grown in a variety of environments, ranging from ponds to tanks, and are suitable for small-scale endeavours. Their commercial advantages include fast growth, resistance to disease, and a diet of readily available algae and zooplankton. The most widely cultured species is the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).

Other important subjects of cultivation in many parts of the world are mollusks. Though few water snails are cultivated, bivalves, especially oysters, are quite important in Asia, Europe, and North America. For centuries the French have cultivated oysters by placing twigs in the sea to which free-swimming oyster larvae could attach. In northern Europe oysters have been cultivated on the ocean bottom, but low winter temperatures limit the extent of this activity. In the Mediterranean the Romans are said to have been the first to farm oysters. Today oysters are cultivated on the Pacific coast of North America as well as on the southern Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. Australia, the Philippines, and South Africa also possess oyster farms, and the Japanese grow edible oysters from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Japanese farms are divided into two classes: some cultivate seed oysters only, while others raise the bivalves for food, especially for export. The Japanese cultivate oysters on the sea bottom (horizontally) and on sticks (vertically). To collect the larvae, which affix themselves to any firm object, such as an old shell or a stone, aquaculturists place various devices in the water. These may be bamboo sticks with shells attached or a rope with shells hanging from it; limed tiles and wooden plates have been used for the same purpose in Europe. Production is greatest in places with good shelter against rough seas, a tidal current to carry food to the larvae, adequate salinity, and optimum temperature.

After some growing time, the larvae are loosened and transported to other areas for maturation under the best conditions. While growing to marketable size, the oysters must be protected against predators, such as sea stars and oyster drillers. As sea star damage cannot be completely avoided when growing oysters on the bottom, a vertical system of culture is preferred in many areas. Oysters grown vertically hang in clusters or in baskets or are fixed on poles in sheltered bays. In an alternative system, oysters are grown on horizontal trays kept some distance from the bottom. Though tray-raised oysters are expensive, they generally survive better than oysters reared directly on the bottom.

Blue mussels are cultivated in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and near Germany in the North Sea and the Baltic. There as well horizontal-bottom methods have been replaced by vertical culture. Originally, the young mussels, collected from wild stocks, were spread on controlled banks leased from the government. The mussels’ capacity to grow in very extensive and dense beds is highly advantageous. Before full-grown mussels are sent in sacks to market, special purification methods are employed to wash out sand. Today vertical culture is practiced with sticks pushed into the ocean bottom or with lines hanging from rafts. Unfortunately, line cultures may be damaged in winter. Thus, experiments have been made with polyethylene net bags and endless tubes of polypropylene netting; the bags must be strong enough to carry the mussels until harvesting.

Many other mollusks are cultivated, including soft clams and scallops. For these bivalves, the problems are roughly the same as mentioned above: collecting the larvae, raising the young under good conditions, protecting against predators, harvesting the adults without injury, and sometimes cleaning for market.

Among inedible bivalves, pearl oysters deserve mention. Pearl farming is one of the most famous industries of Japan, dating to 1893, when a Japanese first succeeded in cultivating pearls. Under the skin of an oyster, the pearl farmer inserts a pearl nucleus (a small spherical shell fragment wrapped in a piece of living oyster tissue). The treated oyster is placed in a culture cage on a floating raft, and, after some months or years, the cultured oyster produces a pearl. Japan’s pearl production is still concentrated along the coast of Mie prefecture, where it was developed. See also cultured pearl.

Crustaceans—mainly shrimps, crayfish, and prawns—are also cultivated. In traditional Japanese practice, immature shrimps are caught in coastal waters and transferred to ponds. Today, mostly in the United States and Japan, shrimps are cultivated by catching adult egg-bearing females. The presence of eggs can be detected by examining the ovaries, usually visible through the shell. The female shrimps are transferred to large seawater ponds adjacent to the sea or to tanks. After hatching, the shrimps are fed in indoor tanks with cultivated plankton. After 10 days they are brought to shallow ponds for further cultivation or for distribution to other farms.

Commercial lobster culture is feasible but is usually not economical. The animals take two to three years to reach market size, and they have a high mortality rate. Lobsters must molt in order to grow and are quite vulnerable during the molting period.

Another important item in aquaculture is seaweed. Laver, or nori (Porphyra species), a red alga, is a traditional part of the Japanese diet and is one of the most commonly farmed species. The Japanese first cultivated this alga in the late 17th century in the brackish water of Tokyo Bay. Originally, a vertical method was used, in which bushes were placed in the water. A horizontal method is now employed: large meshed netting made of rough materials is hung horizontally between poles at the proper depth. The algae grow there by themselves, and the owners harvest them from the nets by hand. Harvesting begins early in November and continues until about March. After the season is over, the gear is removed and stored. Part-time fishers and land farmers often engage in such algae culture.

Other farmed seaweeds include other red algae, such as elkhorn sea moss (Kappaphycus alvarezii) and various Eucheuma and Pyropia species, and a number of large brown algae, including kombu (Saccharina japonica), hijiki (Sargassum fusiforme), and wakame (Undaria pinnatifida). These and other farmed algae are used for food and in industry."

agronomy,  branch of agriculture that deals with field crop production and soil management. Agronomists generally work with crops that are grown on a large scale (e.g., small grains) and that require relatively little management. Agronomic experiments focus on a variety of factors relating to crop plants, including yield, diseases, cultivation, pest and weed management, and sensitivity to factors such as climate and soil. Agronomists may specialize in plant breeding and biotechnology to improve crops. Many agronomists also utilize ecological principles to conserve and protect the environment from the negative effects of agriculture, a field known as agroecology."
5,Agriculture,"African swine fever normally affects domestic pig populations when wild members of the pig family or their products get into contact with the domesticated animals.


By 
Dr Joseph Mugachia


Veterinary doctor.



The human mind is wired to see things through a multiplicity of prisms, that is why I was not surprised by the kind of responses my articles on Morgan’s pig farm elicited.

Majority of readers wondered how the country has not been able to control African swine fever (ASF) or even develop a vaccine to protect pigs from the disease and farmers from the ensuing economic losses.

These concerns are valid because ASF has been with us in Kenya and Africa for over 100 years. The disease often emerges in sporadic outbreaks and then disappears for long periods before reappearing without notice. It happens that way because it is maintained in the wild by wild boars, warthogs and bush pigs.

ASF normally affects domestic pig populations when wild members of the pig family or their products get into contact with the domesticated animals. The virus may also be inadvertently transmitted to domestic pigs by humans or other animals.

Once the first domestic pig is infected, it takes about five to 19 days to show signs of the disease depending on how infectious the infecting virus type is. This long incubation period for some virus types explains why sometimes the disease may have a slow onset.

However, once a sufficiently large number of pigs are infected, the disease moves fast in the herd, particularly when it infects the young and growing stock.

The disease has no treatment but since 2021, research in the UK and the US has shown promising signs of possible development of protective vaccines. The UK version proved fully effective in protecting pigs in the laboratory and is to undergo field trials in countries with large pig populations.

Commercial production of such a vaccine would be the best news for pig farmers.

I must admit ASF is the disease I dread diagnosing to a farmer. The suffering seen in the pigs and the economic loss that follows death and depopulation of the farm are always difficult to communicate. In addition, the farmer must close the farm for about six months to exterminate the virus.

Now, some farmers surprised me with their responses on the ASF article. They said they thought the naming of the disease as African was malicious. They wondered why scientists associate Africa with bad things. They also wondered whether it was because most discoveries were not made by Africans.

I agree there are some biases sometimes in associating Africa with the bad. But in the naming of diseases, there is a very clear scientific protocol that is followed globally. It has nothing to do with the biases of the scientist discovering a disease or a disease – causing agent, process, gene or the observable effect such as yellowness in yellow fever.

The naming protocol for diseases and pathogens has evolved over time as scientific methods of disease diagnosis have kept improving. In the early days when scientific diagnosis was rudimentary, diseases and pathogens were named after places where they were discovered or after people and scientists who first described them.

In some cases, diseases and pathogens were also named after scientists who had contributed highly in researching the problem. For instance, the human brain degenerative problem called Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease was named by the German scientist Walther Spielmeyer in 1922 after the two German neuroscientists Creuzfeldt and Jakob for their work in neuroscience research.

There are others like Nairobi sheep disease, East Coast Fever and Rift Valley Fever that are associated with Kenya and East Africa because it is where they were first described. 

Marburg fever, on the other hand, is named after a city in Germany where it first broke out and was described in humans in a research laboratory. It was traced to Mt Elgon in Kenya where monkeys used in the German laboratory had been obtained from.

Nowadays, with the advent of sophisticated and accurate scientific diagnostic methods, diseases are named after the pathogen, the disease process or the gene responsible for the observed changes. The naming has, therefore, remained objective.

ASF was first discovered by Montgomery in Kenya in 1921. Later it was found in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa before spreading to Portugal in 1957. Montgomery observed the disease was killing pigs imported from Europe in high numbers when they mixed with local ones. Today, we know that it meant the local pigs were carriers of the virus and hence did not show active disease.

From Portugal, the disease spread to other parts of the world including the Americas through the movement of meat and meat products. Some countries initially infected have been able to eradicate the disease through strict control measures but it remains persistent in African countries and recently in South East Asia.

ASF is currently the biggest challenge in pig production and disease problem in animal health. In 2019, the World Organization for Animal Health reported the death or destruction of about 5.9 million pigs globally due to the disease.

crop rotation,   the successive cultivation of different crops in a specified order on the same fields, in contrast to a one-crop system or to haphazard crop successions.

Throughout human history, wherever food crops have been produced, some kind of rotation cropping appears to have been practiced. One system in central Africa employs a 36-year rotation; a single crop of finger millet is produced after a 35-year growth of woody shrubs and trees has been cut and burned. In the major food-producing regions of the world, various rotations of much shorter length are widely used. Some of them are designed for the highest immediate returns, without much regard for the continuing usefulness of the basic resources. Others are planned for high continuing returns with protected resources. The underlying principles for planning effective cropping systems began to emerge in the middle years of the 19th century.

Early experiments, such as those at the Rothamsted experimental station in England in the mid-19th century, pointed to the usefulness of selecting rotation crops from three classifications: cultivated row, close-growing grains, and sod-forming, or rest, crops. Such a classification provides a ratio basis for balancing crops in the interest of continuing soil protection and production economy. It is sufficiently flexible for adjusting crops to many situations, for making changes when needed, and for including go-between crops as cover and green manures.

A simple rotation would be one crop from each group with a 1:1:1 ratio. The first number in a rotation ratio refers to cultivated row crops, the second to close-growing grains, and the third to sod-forming, or rest, crops. Such a ratio signifies the need for three fields and three years to produce each crop annually. This requirement would be satisfied with a rotation of corn, oats, and clover or of potatoes, wheat, and clover-timothy. Rotations for any number of fields and crop relationships can be described in this manner. In general, most rotations are confined to time limits of eight years or less.

The acreage devoted to sod-forming, or rest, crops should be expanded at the expense of row crops on soils of increasing slopes and declining fertility. This will provide better vegetative covering to protect sloping land from excessive erosion and supply organic matter for improving soil productivity on both sloping and level lands. With lessening slope and increasing fertility, the row crops may be expanded, but this should not be done with too much reduction in the sod-forming crops. The differing effects of crops on soils and on each other and in reactions to insect pests, diseases, and weeds require carefully planned sequences.

Broadly speaking, cropping systems should be planned around the use of deep-rooting legumes. If too little use is made of them, productivity will decline; if too much land is devoted to them, wastes may occur and other useful crops will be displaced. Rotations depending wholly on green-manure legumes should be confined to the more level and fertile lands. It is desirable to include legumes alone or in mixtures with nonlegume sod-forming crops as a regular crop in many field rotations. In general, this should occur about once in each four-year period. Short rotations are not likely to provide the best crop balances, and long rotations on a larger number of fields may introduce complications. With a moderate number of fields, additional flexibility can be provided by split cropping on some fields.

The usefulness of individual field crops is affected by regional differences in climate and soil. A major crop in one region may have little or no value in another. In each region, however, there are usually row, grain, and sod, or rest, crops that can be brought together into effective cropping systems.

In addition to the many beneficial effects on soils and crops, well-planned crop rotations also provide the business aspects of farming with advantages. Labour, power, and equipment can be handled with more efficiency; weather and market risks can be reduced; livestock requirements can be met more easily; and the farm can be a more effective year-round enterprise.

3,Agriculture,"A murram road leads the Seeds of Gold team to a one-acre farm in Kimumu, off the Eldoret–Iten Road in Uasin Gishu County.

Known as Green Pastures Smart Farm, the entity hosts fish, poultry and a variety of crops farmed under the aquaponics system.

Charles Makanga, 49, the owner, says nothing goes to waste under the farming system.

“I use water from the fish pond, which is rich in ammonia, to irrigate my crops on the farm. The model I use is that everything on this farm depends on the other,” says Makanga as he leads the Seeds of Gold team to a greenhouse that hosts eight raised ponds where he rears catfish and tilapia.

It all began in 2012, recalls Makanga. He quit maize and wheat farming due to poor returns to try his hand in aquaculture. Initially, he was keeping the fish in eight earthen ponds but moved them into raised ponds inside the greenhouse.

“The ponds are made up of steel and dam liners. Some 7,200 tilapias are in seven ponds while 150 catfish occupy one. Four of the ponds measure 6 by 5m while the others 4 by 3m,” says Makanga.

He went for greenhouses having realised that fish thrives well in warm temperatures.

“When they mature faster at seven months, this cuts my spending on feeds. The colder the temperatures, the more time fish takes to mature,” says the graduate of theology and religion. His poultry unit, located above the pond with catfish, hosts 50 chickens. 

“The fish, mainly the catfish, feeds on the birds’ droppings making it cheaper to run the unit,” he explains, adding he feeds the catfish the droppings because they can survive in acidic water unlike tilapia.

Charles Makanga at his fish farm in Kimumu, Uasin Gishu County.

Farming inside the greenhouse, he observes, gives the right environment for algae and planktons to flourish in the ponds giving his fish extra food.

The farmer sells the bulk of the fish directly to hotels and fish mongers at between Sh150 and Sh250 each.

Besides keeping fish, he also rears bees in a project he started in 2014.

“I have 30 hives from which I harvest nine to 13kg of honey after every four months, process and sell at Sh800 a kilo.”

His farm serves as a demonstration facility where he charges farmers who visit Sh1,000 per day, getting an average of five visitors every week.

Makanga also grows Hass avocados, passion fruits, arrowroots and tomatoes that he irrigates with water from the ponds. He also keeps dairy goats as well as breeds dogs for security purposes.

“My advice to farmers is to start small and expand gradually. If you start big, you might encounter bigger problems and get discouraged,” says the farmer, noting high cost of feeds and lack of skilled farm workers as some of his challenges.

Charles Mwaniki, the assistant director of fisheries at the Uasin Gishu county government, says tilapia and catfish have faster growth when kept in warmer environments like inside greenhouses, especially in the region which experiences very cold weather sometimes.

Demand for fish has gone up in the county, according to him, adding that farmers practising aquaculture have great advantage.

“The daily consumption of fish in Uasin Gishu stands at three tonnes yet we don’t produce enough. Most of the fish comes from Uganda, some from lakes Turkana and Victoria,” says Mwaniki.

1,Agriculture,"The high nitrogen content of fresh chicken manure means it will “burn” plants it comes into contact with, especially tender young plants. Before putting chicken manure in your garden, you need to age it for at least six months, or use it in one of the following ways. First, you can add chicken manure to a compost pile, if you have one going, or just mix it with lawn clippings or dead leaves. Untouched, the compost is ready in six to 12 months, or if you turn the compost every once in a while, you can have it ready in four to six months. A quicker solution is to make manure tea by placing the chicken manure in a burlap sack with a brick or large rock, then soaking the sack in a trash can filled with water for three to four weeks.

If your garden is dormant, you can go ahead and use the fresh chicken manure if you have three or four months before you’ll be planting. Spread 50 pounds of chicken manure over 100 square feet of soil and till it or work it in to a depth of six to eight inches. It will age right in the ground and give your soil a nutrient boost so it’s ready for spring planting if you spread the chicken manure after fall harvest is complete. Chicken manure needs to be worked into the soil within 12 hours of being spread, or much of the nitrogen it contains will be lost to evaporation."
